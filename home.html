<H2>Toolkit Demonstration Sites</H2>

<P>Two demonstration sites were selected to test the concepts
behind the Toolkit:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>Rochester Hills Public Library created <A HREF="http://www.metronet.lib.mi.us/ROCH/GRHO"
  TARGET="_blank">Greater Rochester History Online (GHRO)</A> focusing
  on cultural, historical and governmental information of the community.
  Community partners are Rochester Hills Museum at Van Hoosen Farm
  and the Special Collections Department of Oakland University.
  The project revolved around digitization of the Ray Russell postcard
  collection which includes over 300 postcards depicting downtown
  Rochester and other scenes of early community life in the Greater
  Rochester area in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.
  The project uses a database implemented in MS-Access by Rochester
  staff member Larry Neal. The database provides the potential
  for multiple views of the information across geography, time,
  and other dimensions.
  <LI>The <A HREF="http://www.macomb.lib.mi.us/romeo/" TARGET="_blank">Romeo
  District Library</A> worked with The Library Network to provide
  extensive training in Web publishing to members of the community
  who desired to participate in the new Web effort. Romeo seeks
  to deliver information on topics such as transportation services
  and schedules, in particular for the STAR (Senior Transportation
  Through Advanced Reservation) project. Romeo has also addressed
  the needs of its visually and/or physically handicapped residents
  both by the information they will have online and by the installation
  of adaptive technologies to enable access by the visually impaired
  at the library site.
