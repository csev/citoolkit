</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond"><P>This chapter is structured as a series of sequential steps to guide a project team through the process of dreaming, inviting, planning, implementing, and evaluating an online community information project. By &quot;online community information&quot; I mean to imply a rather narrow subset of the palette of activities undertaken in the name of community networking. This Toolkit’s working definition of a community information project is the use of the World Wide Web to provide ready access to local information. It does not address the use of Internet communication tools such as email, Usenet, and various kinds of two-way conferencing. It also does not treat the issues of bringing local dial-up access to a community; nor does it discuss general policy issues regarding Internet use.</P>

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond"><P></A>It is helpful to be clear and deliberate about the relationships you form as part of a community information project. There are a variety of ways that those involved in your project can interact. &quot;Relationship problems&quot; usually arise because of misunderstandings or dissatisfaction with these interactions. There is a difference between having partners and having participants. Partnership means involving others in the decision making and implementation of the project. Participation means involving others but maintaining control and responsibility for yourself. This is a broad generalization, of course, which in real situations takes on many variations, but the framework is useful for thinking about and managing the relationships which form around a community information project.</P>
<P>Partnership means involving others in the decision making and implementation of the project. You gain a wider base of support and creativity, the potential to attract more resources, and the opportunity to create widespread cooperation instead of competition. You also add complexity which increases the risk of failure and slows down the process. Defining and building a partnership becomes a process in itself which needs attention separate from the processes which the partnership seeks to implement.</P>
<P><A NAME="_Hlk424507397">Participa</A>tion means involving others in a well defined give and take exchange while you, the organizer and facilitator, maintain control and responsibility. Others may provide input into decision making, but final authority lies with the individual or group that &quot;called the meeting&quot;. The primary advantage is the ability to take action quickly and maintain control. Potential disadvantages include </P>

<UL>
<LI>The challenge of maintaining committed and motivated participants when they may not feel ownership of the outcome.</LI>
<LI>Difficulty in effectively incorporating the talents or resources of those not in the controlling organization.</LI>
<LI>The possibility of finding yourself in competition (or being perceived as being in competition) with other initiatives for participants and resources.</LI>
<LI>Difficulty in sustaining the project over the long term.</LI></UL>

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond"><P>Regardless of who is participating and how, a planning process which yields a clearly defined mission and plan of action with measurable outcomes is essential. You may find yourself fleshing out your ideas and dreams from step one, especially if you don’t build partnerships, but don’t be surprised if the planning process takes you in unanticipated directions.</P>
<P>Decisions regarding staffing, financing, training, marketing, technology and design will all come into play throughout the planning process. Each of these topics is addressed in relation to community information projects.</P>

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond"><P><A NAME="_Hlk424824397">Once your project moves from the planning stage into the implementation stage, the importance of the facilitator or coordinator comes into play. Make sure everyone understands his or her role, responsibilities, and deadlines. Identify where accountability is coming from. Develop a picture of the work relationships, procedures and communication channels in your project. Decide how the group will sense their own progress. Decide how progress will be reported outside the group. Come up with strategies for addressing problems.</P>

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond"><P>Create some opportunities for reflection on the project and record lessons learned or stories to share. You may make these available to others through publication, conference presentations, or simply refer to them in the planning stages of your next project.</P>

There are a variety of ways that those involved in your project can interact. &quot;Relationship problems&quot; usually arise because of misunderstandings or dissatisfaction with these interactions. David Wilcox, a consultant, trainer and writer in the United Kingdom specializing in community participation and partnership building both in &quot;flesh and blood&quot; and online communities, has written a wonderful book blending theory and practical advice called <U>The Guide to Effective Participation</U> In it, he discusses the key factors at work when we try to engage others in a project or a process, suggests a framework for understanding these factors, and offers practical methods for successfully managing them.</P>
<P>Wilcox puts forward a five level continuum to describe the possible stances that can be adopted when seeking community engagement. The five types of participation outlined by Wilcox are: </P>

<UL>
<LI>Information, which is simply telling others what is already planned;</LI>
<LI>Consultation, which involves presenting predetermined options, listening to feedback, then choosing an option;</LI>
<LI>Deciding together, which involves soliciting ideas from the participants, allowing them a say in the decisions, but keeping control of implementation;</LI>
<LI>Acting together, which shares both decision making and implementation; and </LI>
<LI>Supporting independent community interests, in which others are offered funds, advice or other support to develop their own agendas within guidelines.</LI></UL>

<P>A hypothetical example of how these stances may translate practically into a community information project to create web sites representing local organizations:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Information: gather public sources of information about each organization, create sites about them, post the sites, inform the organizations, ask them for corrections.</LI>
<LI>Consultation: identify willing organizations, solicit specific information from them, design a few prototypes, seek their feedback, incorporate changes you think are appropriate, post the sites.</LI>
<LI>Deciding together: identify qualified organizations, explore with them good web sites of organizations with missions similar to theirs, brainstorm with them what their site should be and do, decide together on a site plan, solicit content from them, create the sites for them, post the sites.</LI>
<LI>Acting together: identify qualified organizations, help them design their site, train and assist them to create and maintain it themselves, post the sites.</LI>
<LI>Supporting independent community interests: design a grant program whereby interested organizations receive basic web site planning training, then apply for a mix of funding and in-kind support to plan and develop their own web site in whatever way they see fit.</LI></UL>

<P>The last two models require the more complex management of what this paper calls partnerships, while the first three require good planning and some skill in presentation and persuasion. I will call those engaged at these three stages participants. No one approach is better than another. Different approaches are suited for different situations. To be effective, those engaged must be satisfied with their level of involvement. That means consciously deciding beforehand what approach to use and not misrepresenting it. If you design an information or consultative program, but sell it as an opportunity for active participation, you will likely create disillusioned participants, whereas if you clearly explain the &quot;rules of the game&quot; and the reasoning behind them, your chances of having happy participants increases. On the flip side, you need to choose the approach which will yield the outcome you desire. If you want passionately devoted participants, you had better design a program which involves them in decisions and possibly implementation, because commitment comes from feeling ownership and ownership comes from feeling like you invented it yourself. In a real world project, you will find yourself working on different engagement levels with different stakeholders, changing the approaches over time. How much variety in engagement you allow depends on your tolerance for managing a complex process and hard restraints like time and money.</P>

<P><A NAME="_Toc425135137"><A NAME="_Toc453559390"><A NAME="_Toc453652839">Why is partnering so hard?</A></A></A></P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond"><P>Partnership relationships are tricky. Many community networking projects have faced grave challenges in this regard. Why are they so hard?</P>
<B><P>Partnerships are demanding and require trust.</B> Community information projects may bring you into contact with groups you haven’t worked with before in an intense, interdependent relationship.</P>
<I><P>&quot;Although libraries for many years have joined with other libraries to increase the efficiency and decrease the cost of information delivery, public libraries have turned to new types of partnerships to help broaden their resource base and reach more deeply into the community. What is changing is that these libraries are forging alliances and partnerships with organizations many of which have not, until now, been central to the workings of public libraries. Further, these partnerships involve organizations on an operational level in relationships that are more complex and often more mutually beneficial than that of funder and grantee.&quot;</P>
</I><P>By definition, partnership means sharing control and responsibility. Partners have to trust each other enough to be able to be honest about their strengths and weaknesses, to be able to express doubt, reluctance or frustration without fear that it will end the relationship, and to feel secure that others will do what they say they will do. The need for this kind of trust undergird the partnership only increases when the joint work involves cutting edge technology that virtually guarantees glitches and mistakes. The hype and hysteria surrounding the Internet can also cast a spotlight on the activities of a community information partnership, causing stress.</P>
<B><P>The endeavor of creating electronic community information is new and changes at a rapid pace.</B> Even if partnering relationships are old hat and trouble free, the task of &quot;webbing without a net&quot; can test the strongest of relationships. Each partnering group is trying to figure out its own philosophy and use of the Internet while simultaneously negotiating its contribution to the community networking environment. Part of the learning process for anything new sometimes includes failing, changing direction, even dropping out. How many times have you changed your major or your career? It is not unusual for partners to begin enthusiastically, hit a snag, drop out for a while, then re-join. If the climate doesn’t allow for this flexibility, partnering can be miserable.</P>
<B><P>Cultures clash, especially between non-profit and for-profit entities.</B> Consider the variety of philosophies and working habits among K-12 schools, small business owners, colleges, service clubs, libraries, local government, chambers of commerce, churches, hospitals, and grass roots non-profits, to name a few. Differences in philosophy quickly come to light in policy discussions. Misunderstandings about communication needs and styles also lead to resentment and frustration if not recognized and addressed.</P>
<I><P>I was involved as a representative of the library in the early stages of a Free-Net project and there were some rough times. I don’t think you can over emphasize the fact that you need to make certain other people understand you when you talk and likewise that you understand them when they talk. Libraries have a unique perspective. As librarians, we were interested more in the information and access to it by all at public places like the library, while others were interested in the project for communication functions and individual access from home. And I don’t think we understood that in the midst of it; only now looking back is it clear that that was what was going on. –Charles Hansen</P>

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond"><P>If partnering is so hard, then why is everyone doing it (or killing themselves trying?)</P>
<B><P>Because funders like it.</B> Perhaps that is a flip response, but it is increasingly true and is a significant incentive for bringing people to the table. Grant makers like to see collaboration because it reduces redundancy, improves chances of sustainability, and increases the potential impact of programs. But forming partnerships solely to get grant money won’t cut it in the long term.</P>
<B><P>To pool resources and accomplish something no one group could do alone.</B> In an age of &quot;do more with less,&quot; partnerships are the only way to innovate and deliver new services. As libraries realize that they can’t afford not to embrace new technologies and the new roles they imply, they search valiantly for ways to absorb the costs into their service models and tight budgets. Partnerships are an important tool in facing the challenge.</P>
<I><P>&quot;More and more, public libraries must make difficult choices or seek external funds to pay for new programs. And the financial requirements for connecting community members to the Information Superhighway are immense. As they seek resources, library leaders are finding themselves in new and unprecedented relationships with public and private funding agencies of all kinds.&quot;</P>
</I><B><P>To solve complex problems.</B> Problems in economic development, improving education and public health involve hundreds of factors from various community sectors, and unless those sectors work in concert to solve the problems, solutions are elusive. Many community information projects are founded in the service of these larger community goals. </P>
<I><P>For example, the common perception of Silicon Valley is as the home of technological innovation and a model of the information age. But the outlook in the Valley was not always so bright. In the early 1990s, after decades of expansion, job growth slowed dramatically. Key jobs moved outside the area. Regulatory delays, transportation congestion, high housing costs and unpredictable taxation contributed to a high and often prohibitive cost of doing business in the Valley. In early 1992, hundreds of business, government, education, and community leaders assembled in a series of town meetings. Out of that, various initiatives to rejuvenate the region were launched, one of which was SmartValley. Through private and public sector collaboration, Smart Valley has created projects in the last four years that have focused on accelerating the community's adoption of technology, initially in business, now especially in education and local government. The projects demonstrate the value of technology as a means of addressing regional problems such as improving the quality of public schools, streamlining local government, and creating alternatives to transportation gridlock. Two examples are SmartVoter and GovGuide, both sites dedicated to helping the citizen connect with and participate in local government.</P>
</I><B><P>To negotiate conflict</B><I>. &quot;In a time of widespread frustration with politics-as-usual, in which confrontation, hierarchy, and exclusion characterize our primary means of problem-solving, the principles of collaboration are seen by many organizations, communities, and civic leaders as a more effective means of working for change…&quot; </I>That is, well planned partnerships allow people to envision and work together toward a positive goal, rather than complain about or work destructively against some perceived evil.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial"><P><A NAME="_Toc425135139"><A NAME="_Toc453559392"><A NAME="_Toc453652841">Tips</A> for Building Effective Partnerships</A></A></P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond"><P>So what can you do to maximize your chances of building effective partnerships?</P>
<B><P>Start Small. Find a Niche. Be successful. Build from there.</B> In the first wave of community networking and information projects, many of the partnerships tried to do everything all at once…create Internet infrastructure in the community, provide dial-up Internet service, install public access facilities, build training centers and offer classes, foster distance learning, and publish community information. They were so busy doing all these things, they often didn’t have time to carefully build their working relationships. Over time, many efforts burned out or reinvented themselves midstream.</P>
<P>The technology picture for most communities is drastically different today than it was even three years ago. With more and more commercial options available for Internet access, training, and web hosting, the locus of Internet based activity in a community is becoming more and more dispersed. Whereas three years ago a community network may have been the only game in town for access, training, and information hosting, today there may be a variety of options for obtaining those services. This is sometimes due in large part to the pioneering work of community networkers themselves. As the number and diversity of skilled, technologically savvy stakeholders in a community grows, smaller coalitions can concentrate on niches. </P>
<P>For example, in Austin, Texas, the Austin Free-Net &lt;http://www.austinfree.net/&gt; concentrates on creating public access stations and training for those who would not otherwise have access; the Metropolitan Austin Interactive Network (MAIN) &lt;http://www.main.org/&gt; provides free web hosting and publishing training for non-profits, as well as a well organized gateway to Austin information wherever it is hosted; the city of Austin &lt;http://www.ci.austin.tx.us/&gt; undertakes many sophisticated online publishing projects concerning their unique data collections; Austin360 &lt;http://austin360.com/&gt; is a large site created by the parent conglomerate of local media outlets that publishes local news and entertainment, as well as offers free sites for non-commercial groups; and the AFN Neighborhood Network &lt;http://www.afn-neighbor.net/&gt; is a project focussed on putting the Internet to practical use in low income neighborhoods.<SUP> </SUP>These efforts overlap or compete in some respects and specialize in others. What are your unique specialties and what potential partners share your goals?</P>
<B><P>Choose your partners carefully.</B> Partnerships require trust. Who have you worked with successfully in the past? What potential new partners have a good reputation for cooperation? What personal contacts do you or your staff have which can be leveraged into more formal relationships? <I>In Rochester Hills, partners were identified by brainstorming logical choices then approaching those with whom the library already had a collegial relationship.</P>
</I><B><P>Keep the number of &quot;acting together&quot; partners at a level appropriate to the task.</B> Partnership means involving others in the decision making and governance of the project. In general, the more inclusive a collaborative project is, the greater the likelihood that it will survive over the long term. On the other hand, the more partners you add to the mix, the longer, slower and riskier the process becomes. The trick is to find the right balance. The good news is not everyone needs or wants to partner with you at the &quot;acting together&quot; level. You can get partners to support you at the highest level of engagement on the scale.<I> </I>The &quot;supporting independent community interests&quot; level is less entangling because that partner supports you within guidelines you define together without interfering. On the other hand, you can also involve people as participants. A couple of cautions: </P>

<UL>
<LI>Some groups may wish to be partners &quot;in name only&quot; because they do not have the time or resources to partner fully. Their participation may be advantageous to the project because their name lends clout or they can offer money. However there is a danger that such a partner may try to manipulate the relationship down the line. However, if the expectations and responsibilities of each party are clear up front and the &quot;in name only&quot; partners agree not to exert pressure beyond their scope of involvement or subvert the project by acting independently in opposition to it, it can work. <I>&quot;In our first year, our funder micro-managed us to some extent, but in the second year, they trusted us and got out of the way.&quot;—Allyson Knox</LI>
</I><LI>While you want to keep the number of partners down at a workable number, failing to include a key stakeholder, even if you can’t imagine working with them, may predestine failure. For example, a partnership to create an online calendar of events which does not involve whatever local media sources currently fulfill that need in a community may well find itself at odds in the future with a higher profile site drawing on long established sources of information run by that local media interest you failed to approach. If you can’t convince all the key stakeholders to partner, proceed only with your eyes open to the added challenges. <I>At the Traverse Community Network (TCN), their interest in posting local community events led them to approach the small weekly community paper, the Grand Traverse Herald. Mike McGuire presented them with a mocked up prototype and they agreed to supply the weekly information. The Traverse Community Network became their first home on the web &lt;http://tcnet.org/gtherald/index.html&gt;. When the Herald’s sister publication, the larger Traverse City Record Eagle, later went online &lt;http://www.record-eagle.com/&gt;, the Herald was represented there, too, but rather than pull out of their relationship with TCN, the Herald continues to publish its calendar there. The design of their new site &lt;http://www.record-eagle.com/herald.htm&gt; even echoes the graphics from that first prototype.</LI></UL>

</I><B><P>Don’t underestimate the importance of good facilitation.</B> Partnerships need a person or team whose task is to keep the partnership on track. The facilitator leads the planning process, keeps meetings on track, tracks implementation, nurtures communication, and mediates conflict. This takes a lot of skill, effort and commitment. If at all possible, try to design it into someone’s paid job description. If no one on your team has these skills, invest in training. See the bibliography for some good resources.</P>
<P>Good facilitation will avoid the common problems of feeling like meetings don’t accomplish anything, that a project is all talk and no action, that a small subset of the group is doing all the work, that input is ignored, that the project is too vague, that people are fighting turf wars, that one group is calling all the shots, or that sexism/racism/classism or some other bias is infecting the partnership. A good facilitator can help a group be deliberate in the way they communicate and work together. <I>&quot;So often in partnerships, the theory is so inspiring, but people forget about the tangibles. Without someone looking after the details, the work/results process isn’t as effective, efficient or thorough.&quot;—Allyson Knox</P>
</I><B><P>Gauge and account for skill and confidence levels</B><I>. &quot;Ideas and wish lists are little use if they cannot be put into practice. The ability to do that depends as much on people's confidence and skills as it does on money. Many participation processes involve breaking new ground - tackling difficult projects and setting up new forms of organisations. It is unrealistic to expect individuals or small groups suddenly to develop the capability to make complex decisions and become involved in major projects. They need training - or better still the opportunity to learn formally and informally, to develop confidence, and trust in each other.&quot;</I> Because publishing information electronically is so new to most people, their initial confidence and skill levels are quite low. Witness the popularity of books for &quot;Dummies&quot; and &quot;Idiots.&quot; In this situation, it is perhaps unrealistic to expect success with a partnering approach unless significant training and support resources are available. Starting with a less demanding participation level can build success, trust, and confidence which can be tapped later in a more ambitious project. </P>
<I><P>The WebLinks project started with 10 &quot;at-risk&quot; kids who had very limited experience with using computers. The goal was to train the students as web developers, then pair them with non-profit agencies to create web sites. We designed the program with several repetitions of the process, each round working with a new set of agencies. Each round concluded with a public, show-and-tell unveiling of the sites, in which the students got to say &quot;I did this.&quot; In the first round, it was an accomplishment just to get the sites done based on filling information into templates. By the third round, the kids were branching out beyond the template, creating their own designs, manipulating information, and getting much more adventurous and skilled at graphics. It was an incremental process. If we had stopped after the first round, I’m not sure anyone would have felt as successful.—Cynthia Stilley</P>
</I><B><P>Deal with conflict.</B> When conflict arises, and it will, deal with it in constructive ways. Reframe it in terms of understanding the underlying needs and strengths of each point of view and work together to come up with creative ways to meet as many of those needs as possible. </P>
<I><P>&quot;Conflicts are inevitable and necessary in order to air differences. Nevertheless, they can present a barrier to the partnership achieving its goals. Conflicts come up because people feel that their needs, perceptions, rights, power, values, and/or feelings are being attacked or overlooked. When the partnership addresses these concerns as a group, however, new, often innovative, perceptions and options frequently emerge. Conflict can be beneficial in that it allows dissatisfaction and dissention to surface and be dealt with, provides an opportunity to reassess norms for appropriate behavior, tests the strength of current power structures, and breaks the group out of stagnation by stimulating a search for new solutions. Conflict periods may be a partnership's times of greatest growth.&quot;</I> </P>
<B><P>Acknowledge and understand the cultures of each partner’s organization.</B> Each partner comes from a different organizational culture with various constraints. Variations in business cycles, fiscal years, reporting structures or computing platforms, staff turnover, or less tangible (but just as real) strictures such as inflexible policies, resistance to change, or a &quot;we know best&quot; patronizing attitude can all limit the effectiveness of a partner’s contribution. Each partner should identify and share their limitations with the group in an honest way so that they can be factored into plans. Stereotypical assumptions about other partners should also be aired and addressed in a non-confrontational way.</P>
<I><P>&quot;Businesses tend to be impatient with long processes because time is money for them. Universities, governments, and large corporations tend to be concerned about their reputations. Non-profits worry about their financial survival and are loyal advocates for their constituencies. Academics are interested in theories, vision, and process. Schools and governments are often overwhelmed by their bureaucracies and rules. Governments also tend to be fearful because of public scrutiny.&quot;—Allyson Knox</P>
</I><B><P>Keep a local focus.</B> Especially when a community lacks money or people with specific skills, it is tempting to court big players from outside the community to help. This is not a bad thing in and of itself. However, make sure that such non-local entities are sensitive to local control and behave as equal partners. Also be on guard that local partners do not succumb to the ease of being led in unfamiliar territory and subsequently abdicate responsibility. Non-local partners eventually go away. After they leave, will the local stakeholders feel committed and empowered to continue?</P>
<B><P>Guard against fatigue.</B> Remind yourselves often of the benefits each partner derives from the relationship. Explain these benefits in terms that each partner understands. A business owner may respond to the bottom line, while a social worker may value improved networking relationships. Celebrate success. Acknowledge and reward individual contributions. Pay attention to little things like refreshments at meetings and the need to socialize. Make sure that the benefits continue to be worth the considerable time and effort invested. If not, fix the problems or get out.</P>
<I><P>We found it not only helpful, but necessary to set aside time to go on a day-long retreat away from the daily demands and familiar situation. It both rejuvenated the relationships among the group members and brought back into focus what the near term goals were.—Charles Hansen</P>
</I><B><P>Make sure your own house is in order and proceed with integrity. </B>Before you enter into partnerships, examine your own motivations for doing so. Make sure there is support in your own organization for the partnering activity. Be clear about the impact this activity will have on the organization in terms of staffing, time, and money. Be prepared to express intentions and agendas honestly and openly, be specific from the start about your objectives so as not to create false expectations, and do what you say you will do.</P>

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond"><P>As opposed to partnership, in which groups share decision making and responsibility for implementing decisions, participation means engaging in a well defined exchange in which the entity seeking participation maintains control of decisions and their implementation. </P>
<P>Tips for fostering good participation:</P>
<B><P>Allow enough planning time.</B> <I>&quot;Many problems in participation processes develop because of inadequate preparation within the promoting organisation - with the result that when community interest is engaged the organisation cannot deliver on its promises&quot;</I> <I>&quot;Most experienced facilitators and trainers agree that 80% of successful participation lies in preparation - so don't skimp on it.&quot;</I> </P>
<P>If you ask people to participate in something, they naturally want to see some tangible result of their effort. Sufficient planning will allow you to be ready to act and to produce that feedback which will impress and satisfy your participants. Anticipate what might happen and plan a range of responses.</P>
<I><P>When we wanted to start offering Internet training for the general public, we knew we couldn’t do it with staff librarians who were already stretched to cover current services. So we trained volunteer trainers over several months, developed a schedule and then publicized it with a big kickoff during National Library Week. The registrations filled immediately for 2 months of training and a waiting list grew to several hundred names. Even with all that preparation, we still scrambled to schedule extra sessions to deliver on our promises.—Charles Hansen</P>
</I><B><P>Commitment and apathy aren’t things you necessarily control.</B> <I>&quot;People are committed when they want to achieve something, apathetic when they don't. But what leads to commitment? Not, in my experience, telling people &quot;you ought to care&quot;, inviting them to public meetings or bombarding them with glossy leaflets. I think people care about what they are interested in, and become committed when they feel they can achieve something. Hard selling won't achieve that. If people are apathetic about your proposals, it may simply be that they don't share your interests or concerns.&quot;</I> This is especially true of creating online community information. Some people get very excited about the potential of the medium after only minimal exposure, others become committed only after a personal experience convinces them of its usefulness, others simply aren’t interested. Cultivate the people who show interest early on and don’t spend too much time hard-selling the apathetic. The folks in the middle will most likely be turned on at some point in the future. If you’ve nurtured the early adopters, they will be your allies and support in generating future participation. All these processes take time.</P>
<I><P>Since 1995, the Community Access Program, an initiative managed by Industry Canada to help provide Canadians with affordable public access to the Internet and the skills to utilize it effectively, has brought close to 2,200 rural and remote communities online. The program establishes Internet centers in local schools, libraries and community centers that act as "on-ramps" to the Information Highway and provide support on how to make the best use of the Internet. Their Checklist of Success Factors notes that personal enthusiasm and commitment are essential and that a successful project must have at least one champion who is deeply and passionately committed to the project. Wider adoption and buy-in happen when projects provide a way for members of the community to "internalize" technology, creating programs that give people exposure to what technology really is and a way for people to discover how they can transfer computer and information technology into fields that they had not thought of using it in before.</P>
</I><B><P>Clear rules of the game and expectations help nurture follow through. </B>Even excited, committed people get busy or distracted and find it difficult to consistently follow through on promises. This seems to especially plague community information sites in the maintenance phase. The initial push and thrill of publishing the site fades and keeping up with monthly event postings and news gets tedious or takes more time than initially thought. Clear rules and expectations up front about maintaining information and a system of reminders and support can help with compliance. Training your information providers in your procedures both empowers them to act and removes their excuses for not keeping their end of the bargain. Automating functions like event calendar postings or news items in a way that allows editing via the web with a password also eases the maintenance burden. As a last resort, you can pull the plug on a site which despite your best efforts otherwise is out of date and shows no signs of being maintained. It is hard to do so, especially when you consider all the effort put into the initial publishing, but a ghost site is a disservice to everyone involved.</P>
<I><P>The biggest stumbling block so far is the matter of getting updates from people. I have created 22 local pages, and I would say the contacts for half of them are very reliable.  The other half...not so great.  I am sending our my second annual "Remember your web page and update it" letter in mid August, hoping it will stimulate people to get back in the swing in the fall—Madelyn Ryan</P>
</I><B><P>Raising awareness is not just advertising.</B> <I>&quot;For people to become involved in any process or project they need to be aware it is happening, see some benefit or relevance to themselves, and feel confident about their role. The three are closely linked - attempts to raise people's awareness will be more successful if they start by considering the interests of the audience, and what will be a comfortable way for people to respond. Start where people are - value their knowledge and experience. Advertising, leaflets, videos and exhibitions all have a part to play. Networking and personal contact may be more effective, particularly used with workshops techniques.&quot;</I> The importance of personal invitation is especially strong when you are asking people to participate in an activity that is potentially threatening or has a high potential for failure. Few things alarm people over age 30 more than computers. Flyers and advertisements may pique their curiosity, but personal contact may be necessary to calm their fears of failure or embarrassment. On the other hand, children and youth are much less fearful of computers. Instead of reassurance, they may need respect and challenge. Another way to raise awareness at others’ comfort zone is to get out of <I>your</I> comfort zone and go to them. Visit them on their turf on their terms. </P>
<I><P>The Flint Public Library was approached by the Childhood Asthma Task Force to be a member of their interagency project aimed at addressing the serious and growing problem of childhood asthma. Librarian Grace Tucker was assigned to work with them. After the first meeting, Grace volunteered to pull together a list of resources, including relevant web sites. Grace subsequently presented the resource list to the group in print form, intending to publish it also on the FPL web site as a subject guide. However, when the Task Force began studying statistics and maps that had been developed concerning the prevalence of asthma in the Flint area, members began to consider the idea of sharing this information and other resources through a web site. Grace and the library were ready to help. With input from the project coordinator, Grace worked up a prototype and distributed a printed copy. An impressed group gave the green light and the result can be viewed at &lt;http://www.flint.lib.mi.us/catf/catf.html&gt;. In this way, an invitation to participate was turned into an opportunity to demonstrate the usefulness of online information and engage the group in new ways to accomplish their mission. Personal contact was key.</P>
</I><B><P>Aims and objectives go both ways.</B> If you are trying to get people to participate rather than partner, you are by definition deciding the agenda and imposing your goals on the situation. Be honest and forthright about them from the beginning. Spell out the rules and expectations governing the interaction. Even if some potential participants drop out, it is best that they do it for clear reasons and not out of disappointment or frustration because of unclear ground rules. However, don’t forget that your potential participants still have personal goals. They may want to learn a new skill, escape their office, or meet new people. Try to discover these and satisfy them to the extent possible without sacrificing your own goals completely. The result will be happier participants. </P>

<P>It doesn’t have to be long or fancy. The important thing is that it reflects a genuine process of deliberation and decision making and serves as a tool to focus the work. It should be a ready reference and be changed when circumstances require.</P>
<P>Writing a thoughtful plan takes a lot of work and time. It is tempting to discuss ideas and form consensus as you go along, but the value of writing your plan down becomes obvious when things start to feel muddled, conflict arises, or you need to repeatedly inform others about the project.</P>
<I><P>Writing things down is insurance. You can fax it around and people can react (or not react) which then allows them to feel informed and involved, and gets you off the &quot;I didn’t know&quot; hook. Relationships are maintained while allowing things to move forward—Allyson Knox</P>

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond"><P>There are many roads you can travel to arrive at a workable plan. Your organization may practice a particular method already or you may need to do some reading or attend some training to gain some familiarity with the process. You may encounter resistance to participating in a formal process if those involved have had previous planning experiences which were poorly facilitated or were ineffective. Finding solutions that work for all the members sometimes requires a bit of individual discomfort and risk. However, good  planning processes are designed to make sure that all the partners feel comfortable working together, share a common purpose and create a workable plan in which all can take ownership. It also helps anticipate problems and stumbling blocks so that you can plan strategies to overcome them from the beginning instead of being caught off guard and struggling midstream. </P>
<P>Outlined below is a generic outline of planning steps with some basic information about specific techniques which can be used to help with that step. More information about techniques can be found in the resources in the bibliography. Most of the technique descriptions were adapted from Wilcox’s <U>Guide to Effective Participation</U>. You don’t have to do every step. Choose the steps which seem most helpful for your situation. In general, the more diverse your partners or the more ambitious your aim, the more thorough and formal your process should become to ensure a good result.</P>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond"><P>Figure out the players.</B> Determine who could be involved in and impacted by the planning process. One technique for doing this is a stakeholder analysis, in which the following questions are answered: Who will benefit from your work? Who might suffer as a consequence of your work? Who has the power to help or hinder you? Who has relevant skills, money, or equipment? Who has authority to make and enforce decisions?</P>
<P>Common strong supporters of community information projects are libraries, universities, and individual community activists and computer professionals. Other commonly involved stakeholders include local government, K-12 schools, businesses, media, and health care agencies.</P>
<B><P>Set a timetable.</B> Determine how long the planning process might take—not the whole project, just the planning stage. Your potential team members will need a sense of what they are committing to initially. During the actual planning process they can decide the extent of their involvement during implementation stage.</P>
<B><P>Decide who among the stakeholders will be partners.</B> Invite them to be involved in the planning process. You may also identify and make informal contact with potential participants to give them a heads up or to gauge their interest. It can be helpful at this point to review the partners or participants sections. <I>&quot;Don’t contact us too late in the game. We may not wish to get deeply involved in the planning, but keep us informed. If you spring something on us at the last minute and want us to participate on your timetable, that can be hard to say yes to.&quot;—Allyson Knox </P>
</I><B><P>Research and disseminate background information</B>. Your planning team needs to be fully conversant about the issues that the planning will address.</P>
<B><P>Ensure that the participants understand the background information.</B> This can be especially necessary and tricky for technology projects where experience and skills vary considerably. To compound this problem, sometimes the people at the decision making levels of organizations have the least experience and are reluctant to show their ignorance. Some techniques for this are </P>

<UL>
<LI>informal contacts to ask and answer questions.</LI>
<LI>a pre-planning exploration workshop such as hands-on time with the Internet or site visits.</LI>
<LI>Communities Online Game, a simulation in which technology models are explored to address given scenarios with fixed resources </LI></UL>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond"><P>Craft a mission statement</B>: Alternate names for the mission are purpose or vision. As a group, develop a short statement that describes the ultimate aim of your work qualified with some statements that indicate how. For example, if you want to publish local health information online, a mission statement could be &quot;We seek to improve the health of individuals and families in our community by using Internet technologies to connect people with local health services.&quot; If the pre-planning has been done effectively, everyone already has a general sense of the aims. One technique involves having each individual write a mission statement, then share and discuss them, identifying agreements and discussing disagreements. Blend them into a group statement by consensus. Try not to get stuck on nitpicking word choices. You can return to the mission statement later and polish it. Working through the remainder of the planning process can help clarify things.</P>
<P>Sample missions statements for community information projects are available through the bibliography.</P>
<B><P>Discover and commit to shared values</B>.<B> </B>Discuss and form consensus about the values which the group will try to uphold throughout the project. Values commonly expressed (and hotly debated) by community information projects include:</P>

<UL>
<LI>ensuring access for disabled and otherwise disadvantaged people</LI>
<LI>respecting privacy of individuals</LI>
<LI>minimizing financial barriers to participation</LI>
<LI>striving for accuracy, quality and balance in information presented</LI>
<LI>promoting the free flow of information and respecting the individual’s right to choose what information is appropriate for their needs</LI>
<LI>not discriminating based on gender, class, age, race, or ethnicity</LI></UL>

<B><P>Understand the Environment</B>: Create a shared understanding of the various factors which will effect your ability to fulfill your purpose. </P>
<I><P>&quot;[I was least prepared for] the challenge from commercial businesses encroaching upon virtually every area of traditional nonprofit activity (education, libraries, medicine, and so on.), in large measure because of the shift in the economy to an information/service base.&quot;—one respondent to the question &quot;what happened that you were least prepared for?’ posed by the Benton Foundation of participants at the Up for Grabs conference, a gathering of community practitioners to discuss telecommunications policy</P>
</I><P>Some techniques for understanding your environment include:</P>

<UL>
<LI>an environmental scan, in which the group lists factors external to the partner organizations and beyond their control which may influence for good or ill the ability to achieve objectives, then do the same with factors internal to the partner organizations. Because these factors are beyond the direct control of the partners, this exercise serves to air and acknowledge honestly the limitations of the plan, recognize the role simple good fortune may play, and serves as a check against assumptions.</LI>
<LI>a SWOT analysis, in which the group brainstorms internal <U>S</U>trengths and <U>W</U>eaknesses as well as external <U>O</U>pportunities and <U>T</U>hreats. Then discuss ways to build on your strengths, address weaknesses, exploit opportunities, and avoid or eliminate threats.</LI>
<LI>force field analysis, in which the group lists forces acting in favor of your mission and those against it. Underline the most important forces, and of those identify those which can be influenced. Brainstorm lists of strategies for magnifying the positive forces and reducing the negative forces. Reducing the negative forces is a tactical approach which is often overlooked and underestimated.</LI>
<LI>surveys, in which a formal needs assessment or assets inventory is undertaken. This is sometimes necessary when there is not enough information known about a situation to accurately describe the forces at work.</LI></UL>

<P>See the bibliography for more resources to help you with these planning techniques.</P>
<B><P>Decide what the group is going to do.</B> We will call these goals. They should be short descriptive statements of ways in which the mission will be achieved. For example, one way to &quot;to improve the health of individuals and families in our community by using Internet technologies to connect people with local health services&quot; is to &quot;create a popular web site which helps users discover the relevant local health resources available to them to address a specific health concern.&quot; </P>
<P>This planning step can be achieved through a process of generating options, analyzing them, and choosing the best ones. Some techniques for generating options include:</P>

<UL>
<LI>brainstorming, in which the group quickly and intensely, without judgement or regard for practicality, lists possibilities. The ideas are posted for all to see to encourage piggy backing. The goal is quantity in a set amount of time. The next step is to go back over the list and cross off ideas which all agree are out of the question. Group similar ideas into workable options. Brainstorming is usually more appropriate for groups of 5 to 20 people.</LI>
<LI>nominal group technique, in which individuals or pairs are asked to work for 10-15 minutes on answers to a specific question (in this case a re-statement of the mission in question form). The results are then shared with a larger group of 6-8 people and listed for all to see. Others can ask for clarification and refinements can be made. Each member then votes for his or her top five options. If the planning group is large, the top five options arising out of all the sub-groups are presented to a session of the whole. Similar options are consolidated.</LI></UL>

<P>Some techniques for analyzing options include:</P>

<UL>
<LI>a simplified cost/benefit analysis, in which three columns are filled in for each option—costs, benefits, and unknowns. If the unknown information for an option prevents a fair determination of its value, try to find out the information and apply your new knowledge to the appropriate cost or benefit column.</LI>
<LI>pros and cons, in which arguments for and against each option are listed. Below the pros and cons list other influencing factors.</LI>
<LI>head and heart, in which the following questions are answered yes or no: Does this option meet a real need? Is this option fully developed and thought through? Does this option reflect our values? What does our intuition say? Does the customer deserve better?</LI></UL>

<P>Some techniques for choosing among options include:</P>

<UL>
<LI>discussion and consensus.</LI>
<LI>criteria and ranking, in which criteria for judging among the options are developed, then each option is ranked in regard to each criteria. Total ranking is then added up and the ones with the highest totals win. Ranking can be done as a whole group by consensus, or individually. When developing criteria, review your values.</LI>
<LI>proportional voting, in which each member is given 10 votes which he or she can spread among the options in whatever way he or she sees fit. The options with the most votes win.</LI></UL>

<P>See the bibliography for more resources to help you with these planning techniques.</P>
<B><P>Decide how the group is going to achieve the goals. </B>These can be called objectives, strategies or action steps. They should be short descriptions of measurable actions which will help achieve each goal. For example, one strategy for &quot;creating a popular web site which helps users discover the relevant local health resources available to them to address a specific health concern&quot; is to &quot;compile and program a searchable directory of local health resources indexed by health concern by June 15, 1998.&quot; Another might be &quot;demonstrate how to use the directory to 1,000 people by September 30, 1998.&quot;</P>
<P>Making your objectives measurable is very important. How will you know when you are finished or if you’ve been successful if you haven’t defined this for yourself? Deciding how to measure your success depends on external and internal values. How will your work be judged by external people? What will it take to satisfy yourselves? Some example measurements for community information projects:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Quantitative production measures: how many sites, records, pages, or megabytes were produced?</LI>
<LI>Qualitative production measures: How significant is the resource culturally? How unique is the resource? How attractive is the product? How important is the information?</LI>
<LI>Quantitative impact measures: How many times were web pages viewed? How much time did users spend at the site? How deep into the site did users go? How often and what percentage of users return to use the site again? How many and what percentage of the community is aware of the resource? How many and what percentage of the community have effective access to the resource?</LI>
<LI>Qualitative impact measures: How did information impact user’s lives? How satisfied are users with the product? How accessible is the product for people with disabilities?</LI>
<LI>Quantitative participation measures: How many people were trained? How many organizations were engaged? How many people are impacted indirectly by each organization’s involvement?</LI>
<LI>Qualitative participation measures: How satisfied are project participants? How did participating in the project effect individuals? How did participating in the project effect how community organizations carry out their missions? What unanticipated benefits arose from the relationships created by this project?</LI>
<LI>Quantitative effectiveness measures: How quickly can users find what they need? What percentage of the true extent of the information is represented and accessible online? How many and what percentage of users found what they wanted or needed?</LI></UL>

<P>Like the goal setting step,<B> </B>the strategy planning step can be achieved through a process of generating options, analyzing them, and choosing the best ones using the techniques outlined previously.</P>
<B><P>Assign responsibilities to action steps.</B> For each action, identify who is going to do it, by when, and with what resources. If the required staff and resources are yet to be committed or generated, identify the requirements and add an action step which secures them. </P>
<B><P>Decide how and when to measure outcomes.</B> If you have written good action steps, you will have a list of outcomes that can be measured. Now decide what information needs to be collected, and when and how to collect it. Don’t forget that some outcome measures only make sense if compared to measurements taken at the beginning of the project. Don’t forget to assign these tasks!</P>

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond"><P>A great deal has been shared already regarding the art of partnering and promoting participation. Here are some further guidelines on staffing your community information project.</P>
<B><P>Pay people.</B> It sounds simplistic and it isn’t always true, but people tend to behave more accountably when tasks are tied to a paycheck. If at all possible, critical functions of your project should be performed by people who consider it part of their jobs. This doesn’t mean you have to create and fund full time positions. It can be accomplished by hiring contractors, part time employees, or committing a percentage of an existing position to the assigned task. Internships or cooperative education positions, if structured carefully to the timeline of the project and filled with a capable candidate, can also be a creative staffing solution. </P>
<I><P>With 1997 LSCA money, the Lapeer County Library launched a year long initiative aimed at publishing Lapeer County government information on the Lapeer County Information Depot (LCID), the local community information server &lt;http://www.lapeer.org&gt;. Oversight and coordination of the project was performed by Cynthia Terwilliger, assistant director of the library whose position included such duties and who was also community information development chair of the Lapeer County Technology Coalition, overseers of LCID. With LSCA funds, the library hired a contractor and a college co-op student to help implement the project. The three worked together throughout the grant to coordinate the grant activities. As the government outreach project wound down and the contractual staff were finishing their involvement, Cynthia also accepted a new job outside Lapeer County. The Technology Coalition that oversees LCID saw enough value in the progress enabled by these paid positions that they set about raising money to retain the continued services of the co-op student to serve as webmaster for government, library and community service organizations.</P>
<P>"Without funds for a project facilitator and assistant, I am certain that our vision of a content-rich site providing information for all county departments and helping to meet the information needs of the residents of Lapeer County, would not have been attainable. The writing in of funds to support these positions and the scheduling of time for me to work with them was critical to our success&quot;—Cynthia Terwilliger</P>
</I><B><P>Hire consultants carefully.</B> Sometimes it is necessary to hire expertise which does not exist in your project team or that there is not sufficient time or resources to develop. Often in community information projects, this is a technology specialist who helps with planning, installation, programming or training, but it also may include a professional facilitator or administrator, depending on the dynamics or size of the group trying to work together. </P>
<P>A successful experience with a contractor is a two-way street. It starts with a well written, detailed description of the work to be performed and an explanation of other requirements such as deadlines, reporting, and participation in administrative processes. Include in your plan how the functions performed by the contractor will be carried forward after her terms of work are finished and she is gone, and include in the contractor’s work plan any activities necessary for knowledge transfer. Clearly define the deliverables and criteria which govern the successful fulfillment of the contract. Ensure that all payment procedures are in place through your designated fiscal agent. Define for yourselves and the contractor where she fits in your org chart, chain of command, and communication channels. Give her an orientation you would provide to any new member of the team.</P>
<P>On the other side of the coin, ask for and check the references of a potential contractor, not just for subject expertise, but for work style, timeliness, and responsiveness to the customer’s needs. Gauge her ability to see beyond the deliverables to how they fit into the mission and goals of the project. Ensure that her communication skills match your needs for communication. Pay a fair price for experience, but feel free to bargain if she doesn’t have direct experience in the skills you want. However, you must be confident in her ability and motivation to learn and deliver. Finally, decide whether geography is important to you. Depending on the individuals involved, you may not have as easy access to an out of town consultant, or you may find it harder to communicate or keep her accountable. On the other hand, sometimes local politics make an outside contractor desirable or the skills simply don’t exist in the community.</P>
<B><P>Be deliberate about spreading the work around.</B> Nothing burns a person out faster than assigning (or volunteering for) an unreasonable work load. Sometimes a person feels obligated to volunteer or is singled out because he has the most skills. An alternative to piling more work on his plate is to lengthen the timeline for completion of the task and appoint someone who is motivated but not as skilled. Another technique is to do a skill inventory of the team to discover talent or experience lurking in the group. At the very least, take something off his full plate before adding something new. Two more reasons for spreading the work around is to avoid the formation of cliques which upset the balance of power in a team, and to guard against disaster if your worker bee is assigned to another hive. </P>
<B><P>Treat your volunteers like paid contractors.</B> Sometimes people fall into the trap of believing that volunteers will be an easy answer to staffing problems. They belatedly discover that managing volunteers is hard work. Volunteers are just like contractors, except their payment is something other than money. Sometimes it is the opportunity to gain experience or learn a new skill. Sometimes it is the reward of helping other people. Sometimes it is to make new friends, get out of the house, or to feel useful. Sometimes it is to fulfill obligations like a service requirement for graduation, a work requirement to receive government aid, or part of a sentence served for a crime. Whatever the compensation, the volunteer manager should know what it is for each volunteer and understand how that effects his or her accountability. Aside from that important distinction, the section on hiring a contractor applies equally to volunteers. </P>
<I><P>Over time, I noticed three patterns among our volunteers. One set of people stopped participating as soon as the novelty wore off. They were extrinsically motivated by learning something new, but once the work got repetitive, they no longer were committed. Another set of people stayed with it a little longer even when the novelty wore off because they felt they had made a personal commitment and wanted to fulfill their obligation. The third set, mostly retirees or those without other strong demands like a family or work, have stayed on and can’t do enough! They are so self-motivated that they find ways to make it interesting and fresh for themselves. Volunteers are a valuable asset, but they do require time and energy not only to find, but also to train and retain.—Charles Hansen</P>
</I><B><P>Don’t overlook untraditional populations</B>. Either because of stereotypes or uncreative thinking, many sources of personnel are often overlooked, perhaps because the planning team itself is relatively homogenous, if not by race, gender, and ethnicity, probably by age or education.</P>
<P>Senior citizens can be fantastic resources in a community information project—they often are retired and have flexible schedules (but don’t assume they aren’t busy!), they tend to be very loyal and responsible, they often have deep roots in the community and know a lot of people, and contrary to stereotype, many are eager to learn about computers and become skillful users. </P>
<P>Youth can also make excellent personnel. They often combine the enviable qualities of curiosity and fearlessness which are important to mastering and exploiting technology. (Although to be sure, too much fearlessness should be tempered with adult guidance. Learning to balance exuberance and responsibility can be a valuable maturing process for kids.) Youth also tend to have open minds, creativity, and energy. If managed well and treated with respect, youth can make important contributions.</P>
<I><P>All of our help desk folks have been high school and college age kids. They know a lot about the technical aspects of unix, sendmail, configurations, and the like. In our new library, we’re going to have 19 public access computers in a special room and this will be staffed with high school and college students.—Mike McGuire</P>
</I><P>Other overlooked populations might include disabled people, ethnically or culturally isolated groups, and the economically disadvantaged. The key to getting involvement from any group is to make contacts, build bridges of trust and understanding, and be sensitive and accommodating to special needs. It is tempting to assume that the accommodations will take too much effort or resources, and then use this as an excuse not to reach out. Casting a larger net does not require sacrificing the goals or standards of your project. If handled skillfully, it increases the chances for success. </P>
<I><P>When the Genesee District Library was seeking participants from organizations in Montrose, Michigan who were willing to learn how to build and maintain web pages on the Genesee Free-Net, an older woman volunteered from the Senior Center. She had suffered a severe stroke years ago and had relearned how to walk and talk, but had not recovered the use of her right arm. She was interested and motivated, but not very confident of her ability to operate a computer. With some adjustments to monitor resolution and the mouse, patience, and encouragement, she was very successful. She paid back the extra attention with loyalty to the project and invaluable word of mouth marketing.</P>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond"><P>Grants</B> Some of the big dollar, high profile, competitive grant opportunities for community information projects are: </P>

<UL>
<B><LI>The Telecommunications and Information Infrastructure Assistance Program (TIIAP) </B>TIIAP is administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce. It provides matching grants to non-profit organizations such as schools, libraries, hospitals, public safety entities, and state and local governments. Grants are used to fund projects that improve the quality of, and the public's access to, education, health care, public safety, and other community-based services. The grants are used to purchase equipment for connection to networks, including computers, video conferencing systems, network routers, and telephones; to buy software for organizing and processing all kinds of information, including computer graphics and databases; to train staff, users, and others in the use of equipment and software; to purchase communications services, such as Internet access; to evaluate the projects; and to disseminate the project's findings. More information about this very competitive program is on their web site: http://www.ntia.doc.gov/otiahome/tiiap/index.html</LI>
<B><LI>Library of Congress/Ameritech National Digital Library Competition</B> With a gift from Ameritech, the Library of Congress is sponsoring a competition to enable public, research, and academic libraries, museums, historical societies, and archival institutions to create digital collections of primary resources. More information at http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/award/index.html</LI>
<B><LI>National Endowment for the Humanities</B> Various opportunities exist for digitizing collections within the funding guidelines of the National Endowment for Humanities’ Divisions of Preservation and Access, Public Programs, and Research and Education. http://www.neh.fed.us/index.html</LI></UL>

<P>At the state level in Michigan, some opportunities include:</P>

<UL>
<B><LI>Library Services and Technology Act (LSTA) subgrants</B> The Library of Michigan administers a competitive subgrant program through The Library Services and Technology Act. The &quot;advanced technology: research and demonstration projects&quot; funding area  is designed to help Michigan libraries &quot;be forward looking and to participate in &quot;leading edge&quot; projects to help to develop the next generation of information skills and technology. This funding area is intended to assist libraries and library networks in pioneering new applications of information technology, and in sharing their knowledge with other Michigan libraries.&quot; More information and applications are available on the Library of Michigan web site: http://www.libofmich.lib.mi.us/lsta/lstaprog.html</LI>
<B><LI>Technology Literacy Challenge Fund (TLCF)</B> The Michigan Department of Education administers the Technology Literacy Challenge Fund which </FONT><FONT FACE="Times-Roman">awards &quot;competitive grants to local and intermediate public school districts and academies to promote the acquisition and effective use of technology and telecommunications to improve the delivery of educational services.&quot; Some funded projects include using technology in community education, outreach with the business community, and school/family support. More information is available at </FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond">http://www.mde.state.mi.us/money/</LI>
<B><LI>Michigan Humanities Council</B> The Michigan Humanities Council &quot;encourages proposals for collaborative projects in communities, especially in those with limited access to humanities programming and resources. The emphasis is on partnerships that use the disciplines of the humanities to explore community issues and concerns.&quot; More information at <BR>
http://mihumanities.h-net.msu.edu/grants/index.html</LI></UL>

<P>Also explore local or regional grantmakers such as Community Foundations (consult the Council of Michigan Foundations for pointers http://www.novagate.net/~cmf/). It may require some extra time and effort to educate local foundations about the technology, but local funders are often more accessible and flexible, with less competition and bureaucracy. Especially for first time efforts at community information projects, it can be overwhelming to be infused with cash and saddled with the restrictive grant administration requirements of large grants.</P>
<P>An excellent starting place for grant quests is the Foundation Center, publisher of the Foundation Directory and Philanthropy News Digest &lt;http://www.fdncenter.org&gt;. Remember that you aren’t looking for grants for computers and networks. You are simply using technology to address health, history, children’s issues, etc.</P>
<B><P>Sponsors</B> Another source of start-up funds for community information projects are sponsors. Of course the partners who are planning and implementing the project may also contribute funds. However, there may be local businesses, organizations, or individuals who could be convinced to lend financial support without being involved in the day to day planning and implementation. Sponsors can be acknowledged in on-screen credits and marketing materials. You’ll want to keep the list of sponsors small by asking for significant funding from each. Too many sponsors devalues the public relations boost for each sponsor. If you want to approach many groups, consider a direct appeal fundraising campaign. </P>
<I><P>When planning a corporate funding campaign, there is one basic fact that must be recognized:<B> they don't have to give</B> . . .every contribution represents money that would otherwise have gone to pay taxes, to pay shareholders, or to reinvestment in future growth. Charitable support is generally seen as an "investment." Companies are looking for a primary benefit to their community of customers, employees, and shareholders, and only secondarily to the society at large. Given this very business-like attitude its easy to understand that the following are the main reasons companies give: supporting services that benefit employees and their families, supporting services that educate employees and raise their skill levels, providing public recognition and prestige to the company, improving the market for a company's products, supporting the personal interests of senior management, supporting groups in which employees are involved, responding to peer pressure, and  maintaining good community relations.&quot;</P>
</I><B><P>Direct appeals </B>A direct appeal fundraising campaign can be a wonderful, if not exhausting, way of creating widespread awareness and buy-in for your community information project. Between your planning and implementation phase, an effective presentation trotted around to every service club, association, government office, church and social hall can raise funds while also serving as an informal barometer of community interest and readiness. However, be ready with a clear plan and budget, ask for a target amount from each group or provide a scale of giving levels, and be ready administratively to take donations. Sometimes an incentive is also effective (but make sure you can deliver on it). </P>
<B><P>Sell the benefits, not the technology.</B> Potential funders may be mystified, terrified, or just plain uninterested in technology itself. Talking about computers may raise images of the last bad experience they had with a phone answering system, an ATM, or computerized record keeping system. <I>&quot;Tailor your explanation of the benefits of your networking project to the various program areas that do interest your potential funding partner. This may be obvious, but it is pretty hard to do. Never mention &quot;bandwidth&quot; until invited to do so by a program officer&quot;</P>
</I></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial"><P><A NAME="_Toc425135149"><A NAME="_Toc453559402"><A NAME="_Toc453652851">Continuing Funds</A></A></A></P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond"><P>Many community information projects stumble on the issue of financial sustainability, especially if the start up costs were funded with grants. Think about both stages of financing when planning your project. Some approaches used by others include:</P>
<B><P>Institutionalization</B> Although worrying about the financial sustainability of a community information project may lead you to feeling like <I>you</I> need to be institutionalized, what I mean to say is that there are many existing organizations in your community who may incorporate significant portions of the ongoing costs into their operating budgets. A library is certainly a likely candidate. Local governments, higher education, United Way and local media companies are others. Strategic partnering with these types of entities from the beginning will help them discover how these activities relate to their mission and perhaps lead them to embrace community networking as central to their work and thus a regular part of their budget.</P>
<B><P>Grants</B> A patchwork of smaller grants aimed at specific aspects of your overall community information project can provide needed funds. This approach is good for adding new resources or enhancing existing ones through training or marketing, but it is difficult to win grants for ongoing operational costs like staffing, connectivity, or data maintenance. Another way to benefit from grants is to be written into other grants as a tool for marketing, communication, or coordination. For example, if a child care partnership writes a grant to improve child care opportunities in your community, the budget could include funds for using your community information project to publish a directory or facilitate the work of the group online. </P>
<B><P>Sponsorship and Direct Appeals</B> See these sections in the start-up funding section. These approaches can be used repeatedly throughout the life of a community information project.</P>
<B><P>Fees</B> Some community information projects charge fees for services. The first consideration is whether fees are compatible with the values of the project. Libraries often have strong feelings about erecting any financial barriers to participation or access and decide that fees work against their aims and image as a democratically supported public good. They would rather exhaust all other avenues of fundraising first or limit the project rather than charge fees. However, community partners may not share those values or even understand them. These value conflicts are often central to the decision about imposing fees.</P>
<P>If you do decide to charge fees, it requires careful planning and a sound business model. Make sure the fees are worthwhile, meaning that they don’t cost more to administer than they do as a source of income. Survey carefully what your target market can afford and will pay. If your services were free in the past, will users balk at imposed fees down the road? How will charging fees increase the expectations of users for service and support? Weigh the pros and cons of competing with local commercial access, web design, hosting, and training businesses. Might a tiered system work, where basic services are free or low cost and enhanced services cost more, or in which target audiences are given preference?</P>
<P>Some common services for which community networks charge are dial-up Internet access, email accounts, web page hosting, web page design, discussion group hosting, domain name registration, special programming for interactive web page features, and consulting. </P>
<B><P>Advertising</B> If your community information site generates a lot traffic the opportunity to advertise on it may be an attractive option for local businesses and a source of income for your project. Again, this requires careful planning and a sound business model. Would the benefits outweigh the costs of administration? What would advertisers be willing to pay? How would your users react to advertising? How would you maintain separation between the creation of content and the influence advertisers? Would your stance on user privacy be compatible with gathering the statistics necessary to be able to effectively sell advertising? <I>CityCare in Las Vegas &lt;http://www.citycare.com/&gt; provides an interesting advertising framework to support web based communication of area non-profits.</P>

Track all donations, assigning dollar values to in-kind goods and services. In addition to providing essential documentation for grant writing and fund appeals, assigning dollar amounts to in-kind resources also acknowledges and reminds the planners of the value of volunteers. Track the costs of raising money so that you can determine which methods are most cost effective. </P>

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond"><P>Training, training, training. If you think your community information project won’t need it, think again. Even if you have the luxury of assuming that your end users are savvy Internet users, you will probably need to address the learning needs of some other human component of your project, be they funders, planning partners, information providers, or the implementation team. Online technologies are too new and the rate of innovation is too constant for any project to stand still in respect to training.

<P>Will you offer training opportunities free of charge? A common problem with free, &quot;first-come, first-served&quot; classes for the general public is keeping participation levels adequate to justify costs. The problem is usually not registration levels, but rather no-shows. Some ideas for minimizing the no-show problem are keeping a short lead time between registration and the date of the class, reminding registrants beforehand by phone or mail, requesting that adequate notice be given for cancellation, collecting a registration fee which will be returned to them when they attend, &quot;black-listing&quot; no-shows from registering for future classes, intentional overbooking.</P>
