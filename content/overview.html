        <UL>
          <LI><B>Book:</B> A 250 page book entitled <I>Building a Community
          Information Network: A Guidebook.</I>

        </UL>

        <P>The remainder of this page provides more details on how to
        use each of these components of the Toolkit. </P>

        <P>In addition to being available in electronic form, some components
        of the Toolkit may also be available in other formats. For instance,
        the videos may be available in VHS tape format. For the most
        current information as to this potential availability, periodically
        check the version of this page on the Web site.</P>

        <P>Following is an overview of each of the Toolkit components,
        and how best to use them.</P>

        ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALT="Book Overview"></H2>

        <P><I>Building a Community Information Network: A Guidebook</I>
        provides an introduction to building a community information
        network as well as an overview of Web publishing in the community
        information context.</P>

        <P>The book is provided in MS-Word format (Word '97) and in Adobe
        Acrobat PDF.</P>

        <P>How you view the material is a matter of personal choice.
        For instance, most readers of the guidebook will probably want
        to print chapters for offline viewing. Readers may also want
        to view some chapters online so as to see diagrams in color;
        an example is Chapter 6, which includes sample color photographs.
        Others may wish to adapt chapters or portions of chapters for
        use in their own training projects (subject to the provisions
        of the Toolkit copyright).</P>

        ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALT="Training Materials Overview"></H2>

        <P>The Toolkit training materials are a collection of PowerPoint
        presentations that are suitable for use in face-to-face training
        sessions. The training materials were developed as part of training
        sessions for one of the Toolkit demonstration sites. You can
        use the materials as-is, or adapt them to meet the particular
        needs of your community information network team.</P>

        <P>The training materials are provided in PowerPoint and in HTML
        form.</P>

        <H2><IMG SRC="../navbar/software_button.gif" WIDTH="137" HEIGHT="31"
        ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALT="Software Overview"></H2>

        <P>The Toolkit includes demonstration software for running a
        community calendar and for supporting online community discussions.
        The software is database-driven and is implemented as an Active
        Server Pages (ASP) application that interfaces with a standard
        database software pacakge such as Microsoft Access or SQL.</P>

        <P>The Software section also provides complete, step-by-step
        instructions on installing Windows NT, Microsoft Internet Information
        Server (IIS), and the Toolkit demonstration applications.</P>

        <P>The Toolkit software is suitable for use as-is, or a site
        might choose to tailor the tool to meet its particular needs.
        (Source code for the software is included.)<FONT SIZE="-2"><HR ALIGN=LEFT></FONT></P>

        <H3>A Note on Browser Windows in This Site</H3>

        <P>When you click on a navigational button as shown on the left,
        the relevant introductory content will load in the right hand
        frame. For instance, when you click on the <IMG SRC="../navbar/overview_button.gif"
        WIDTH="137" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">
        button, this page, providing an Overview, appears.</P>

        <P>When you click on a primary content item, such as a chapter
        in the Book section or a presentation in the Training Materials
        section, a new browser window will open with that content. This
        allows your browser to devote as much screen space as possible
        to the content. Simply close the new window when you are done
        viewing the item.</P>

        <H3>Viewers for Toolkit Content</H3>

        <P>For your convenience, here are links to freely-downloadable
        viewers for Toolkit content.</P>

        <H3>A Note Concerning Links</H3>

        <P>Throughout this Toolkit are links to various Web resources.
        While we have tried to verify that links are active at time of
        publication, it is inevitable that some Web links will change
        or become inactive. If you discover a broken link, you may be
        able to locate the content by using a search engine to specify
        the title or key words related to the item you seek.</P>

        <H3>A Note Concerning Security</H3>

        <P>The Toolkit contains demonstration software and complete instructions
        on installing Windows NT as a Web server environment. If you
        should choose to run your own Community Information server, one
        of the obligations you assume is security. Security requires
        constant vigilance and could be the subject of its own toolkit.
        Security management encompasses many areas, including:</P>

        <UL>
          <LI>good password management
          <LI>virus detection
          <LI>log analysis (to ascertain possible attack attempts)
          <LI>installing firewalls or other server protection measures
          <LI>monitoring security announcement services such as <A HREF="http://www.cert.org/"
          TARGET="_blank">CERT</A>
        </UL>

        <P>If you choose to run your own server, be sure that proper
        security measures are in place for that server and for your entire
        network.</P>

        <H3>A Note Concerning Y2K Issues</H3>

        <P>This Toolkit is delivered on the cups of the new millennium.
        A project launched at this time needs to be sure server and authoring
        softwre and hardware are Year 2000 (&quot;Y2K&quot;) compliant.
        Visit the Web sites of vendors of all your mission-critical components
        in order to determine Y2K readiness.</P>
