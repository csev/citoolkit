Toolkit</FONT></H2>

<P>Welcome to the Community Information Toolkit. This goal of
the Toolkit is to provide public libraries and other institutions
with the tools necessary to begin building a Community Information
Network.</P>

<P>This Toolkit provides a 250 page Guidebook; a four-part introductory
training video series; a set of PowerPoint files suitable for
use in training efforts; and a set of demonstration software tools
to provide a community calendar and a community forum. The Software
section also includes complete, step-by-step instructions on installing
Windows NT, Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS), and the
Toolkit demonstration applications.</P>

<P>See the <A HREF="overview.html">Overview</A> section for more
information about the Toolkit components. Be sure to note the
Toolkit <A HREF="../copyright.html">copyright</A> provisions.</P>

<P>The components of the Toolkit are provided via the Toolkit
Web site, <A HREF="http://www.mel.org/citoolkit/">www.mel.org/citoolkit</A>.
Some organizations have also received the Toolkit in CD-ROM format.
The contents of the CD-ROM are identical to the initial contents
of the Web site.</P>

<H3>Training the Trainers</H3>

<P>The Community Information Toolkit is a multimedia collection
of tools and tips for teaching public library staff and community
partners how to get their local community information on-line.
During this one day training session, trainers were taught how
to use these tools in designing their own electronic community
information curriculum.<BR>
The training included:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>A review of web site &quot;best practices&quot;
  <LI>Content selection guidelines
  <LI>Content conversion and maintenance issues
  <LI>Choosing technologies
  <LI>Working with digital images, audio and video
</UL>

<P>The creation of this Toolkit was sponsored by the Library of
Michigan. Funding for the project came from the Ameritech Foundation.
The Toolkit project was managed by Merit Inc.</P>

<H3>Demonstration Sites</H3>

<P>Two demonstration sites took part in this project:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>The <A HREF="http://www.metronet.lib.mi.us/ROCH/">Rochester
  Hills Public Library </A>created a Web-accessible database of
  community history artifacts, primarily postcards from various
  points in time.<IMG SRC="../images/grho.gif" WIDTH="220" HEIGHT="185"
  ALIGN="RIGHT" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">The database uses
  Active Server Pages (ASP) and a Windows NT server running Microsoft
  Access. The postcards and other materials were digitized by a
  professional photographic processor onto Photo CD format, then
  converted to GIF or JPEG image format for display on the Web.
  The database enables multiple views of the same artifacts; for
  instance, a user could conceivably select items to inspect based
  on the date the postcard was written, the subject of the photograph
  on the postcard, or the name of the person to whom the postcard
  was addressed. See <A HREF="http://www.metronet.lib.mi.us/ROCH/GRHO">Greater
  Rochester History Online (GHRO)</A>
  <LI>The <A HREF="http://www.libcoop.net/romeo/">Romeo District
  Library</A> formed a community information networking team to
  establish a new community information Web site. The Library Network
  provided hands-on training for the Romeo team. In addition, Romeo
  installed a Web terminal with special adaptive technologies to
  serve the needs of people with visual or motor impairments. Romeo
  intends to make use of calendaring software to provide information
  on programs, events and schedules of the Parks and Recreation
  Department, STAR (Senior Transportation Through Advanced Reservation),
  and other community agencies.
