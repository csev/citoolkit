<P>Congratulations! You've discovered the hidden preface for the
Community Information Toolkit. This is a private reflection published
in a semi-public manner, intended for my friends and colleagues
to discover at random.</P>

<P>It is hard to believe that this project began over two years
ago. Virtually every member of the team has gone through some
sort of transition:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>Sue Davidsen, who wrote the original proposal for Merit,
  moved to the University of Michigan Library, where she continues
  to manage MEL (the most undervalued and underappreciated subject
  catalog on the Internet.)
  <LI>Eileen Palmer, who worked at the Library of Michigan and
  helped define the vision for the Toolkit, became Deputy Director
  of The Library Network and a member of the team implementing
  the project.
  <LI>Todd White, who helped with the Toolkit for Merit, is going
  to go to library school.
  <LI>George Needham, the State Librarian, resigned for a position
  with OCLC.
  <LI>Jeff Johnson, deputy State Librarian, retired to pursue new
  interests.
  <LI>Charles Severance, who worked with me on virtually all aspects
  of the project, left a two decade career at Michigan State to
  become deputy director of the Media Union at the University of
  Michigan.
  <LI>Larry Neal, who managed systems and implemented the way-cool
  postcard database at Rochester Hills Public Library, left with
  his director to build a new library from the ground up. (If they
  build a place as wonderful as RHPL, the world of public libraries
  in Michigan should figure out how to clone them.)
</UL>

<P>So that leaves a few of us associated with the project who
didn't change Day Jobs -- Betty Van Dam of Merit, who managed
the project; Richard Truxall of TLN; Cindy McIntyre at Romeo District
Library. Either we're happy with our jobs, or for some other reason
we've escaped the Toolkit Career Transition Hex.</P>

<P>Probably for all of us associated with this project, there's
been pain as well as pleasure. I know the length of time it took
us to complete the project has been frustrating to some. I hope
and believe the end product is worth the wait.</P>

<P>I'm especially proud of our first video, <I>Building a Community
Information Network</I>. A lot of work went into that piece, and
we were fortunate to be able to tape a variety of experts, as
well as community networking pioneers in a variety of locations.
I hope the end product is shown widely in Michigan -- at public
libraries, on cable access channels, and elsewhere -- because
I believe this can help set the stage for communities to start
new projects.</P>

<P>We owe a big debt to folks who let us invade their workspace
and point cameras in their faces and extract bits of wisdom --
the good people at the Flint Public Library, Larry Neal at RHPL,
Steve Cisler, Joan Durrance, Mike Mosher, Lou Rosenfeld, my old
colleague Erik Larson, now at the Chicago Symphony... My worst
offense was to show up at the Otsego County Library in Gaylord
on a Friday afternoon and with no advance notice ask the director
to let me point a camera at her so we could capture her unique
story of partnering. My thanks and apologies, Maureen Derenzy
-- you tell your story well under last-minute interview conditions!</P>

<P>One special joy was observing the excitement of new Web publishers.
The folks at the Flint Public Library have seen this with their
teenaged content providers. The community members in Romeo showed
this kind of excitement after Richard Truxall provided hands-on
training. I think Ciny McIntyre in Romeo and others like her will
take pleasure in seeing such excitement translated into online
community content.</P>

<P>I also hope and expect that the remaining videos, the Guidebook,
the demonstration software, theWindows NT and Toolkit documentation
(what a huge collection of information that comprises!) and the
training materials will be of use to a variety of new CI projects.
(Sheryl Cormicle-Knox' chapter is a gem that could've been a book
in its own right.)</P>

<P>My first exposure to community networking in the Web context
came in 1995 when I learned of the Community Access Project run
by Industry Canada and Schoolnet. In 1996, during a visit to New
Brunswick I had the privilege of visiting one of the most charming
and magical towns you'll ever see, Gagetown. This former mill
town of a few hundred people had 9th grade students putting up
Web pages on the history of Canada and the particulars of their
community way back before most Americans were aware of the Web.
I hope someday, when the history of community networking is written,
it tells the story of New Brunswick as a leader in how to do community
networking right -- combine community access, national leadership,
and local championship. If 9th grade students in a tiny school
in a tiny town in Canada were doing this in 1996, then anyone
-- anywhere -- can launch community networking projects today.</P>

<P>I am optimistic that given a bit of vision and energy any public
library in Michigan or elsewhere that chooses to do so can take
a leadership role in community networking. I only have two fears:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>That technology will overwhelm some projects, as the bewildering
  array of technology choices, from ASP to XML and everywhere in
  between, sucks attention away from content work.
  <LI>That some projects will find themselves with lots of energy
  up-front, and lots of sponsors and lots of press releases, with
  nothing to deliver on the back end. I've been involved with Web
  projects since March of 1993 -- when the Web was born -- and
  I've seen too many projects where there's more effort spent planning
  and promoting than in publishing.
</UL>

<P>The real hero in any community information project, or any
publishing effort, is the person who adds the next page of valuable,
current, well-written content.</P>

<P>Here's to thousands and eventually millions of such pages on
community information sites in Michigan and everywhere!</P>

<P>If you discover this note, send me some e-mail and tell me
how your CI project is going. Let's hope the Toolkit is useful,
and let's look forward to Toolkit II.</P>
