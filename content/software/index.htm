<H2>Community Toolkit Software</H2>

<P>The Community toolkit includes software to provide an events
calendar and on-line forum tool for the users of the software.
The software is written to run on Windows NT 4.0 with Active Server
Pages. The data is stored in Access databases so users can develop
their own procedures for inserting data.</P>

<P>The software is provided with full source code. It is intended
as an example implementation for others to use and adapt. However
it may be suitable for some organizations to use without any modifications.</P>

<H3>Latest Version</H3>

<P>As with any software package, if you are installing it from
a CD-ROM, there may be a better version on-line. You can check
the project site at <A HREF="http://www.mel.org/citoolkit/">http://www.mel.org/citoolkit/
</A>for the latest information. Check that site for details on
how to report bugs and request features for the software.</P>

<P>It is hoped that the user community will improve, expand, and
then share their source code to help this become a more robust
product over the years.</P>
