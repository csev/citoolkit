Once you have downloaded the ZIP file for the Community Toolkit ASP code from the web or have located it on the CD, you use a ZIP program to open the file.  To continue we press <b> Extract</b>.

You must extract this information into a directory in your web hierarchy called
<b>Community</b> which will appear as
<b> http://localhost/community/</b>. In a standard configuration this would be
<b> C:\InetPub\wwwroot\Community\</b> with the appropriate drive letter.
In this example, you should extract to <b> C:\InetPub\wwwroot\</b>.  The <b> Community\ </b>
is part of the file name stored in the ZIP.

<b>Installing the Toolkit Administration Tool</b>
<P>
From the web or from the CD-ROM run the ZIP program on the Toolkit Administration tool.
This tool creates databases and manages those databases.  You must extract the file to a temporary directory and run the <b> setup.exe</b> from that directory.

Setup programs are strange creatures.  They have many .DLL and .OCX files which they want to install in addition to the main programs in question.  Often the .DLL files are already installed on the system.  When these files are in use, they may not be updateable until the next reboot.
<P>
Setup has two phases - first it copies in a few files necessary for setup to run and then (usually) reboots.

This is an example of a file-related complaint.
<p>
Most of the complaints are files which were provided by Microsoft.  In this example, we are looking at the file <b> MSREPL35.DLL</b>.  The key is that these files have version and date information.  Typically files are included in a setup package in case they were missing on the destination system.  In <i>this</i> setup package, the only critical DLL is <b> ODBCTool.DLL</b>.  Generally it is quite safe to keep the existing DLLs on your system.
<p>
So for this prompt we want to keep the existing file, so we press <b>Keep</b>.
<p>
Normally, these DLLs change quite slowly so these version conflicts hardly ever occur.  But with Windows NT 4.0 and the Y2K problem, many new versions of these files (especially database related files) are released as one or another small bug is fixed.  Generally the versions in the latest service pack are the very best versions.  So it is quite important to re-run your service packs after installation of a program in case the setup process inadvertently dropped you back a level in some DLL.  After Y2K settles down, there will be far less conflicts between setup packages and service packs.  ;)

This completes the necessary installation tasks.  Up next you will run the toolkit administration tool to create a database.
