<!-- file:110setupcopying-->
Setup programs are strange creatures.  They have many .DLL and .OCX files which they want to install in addition to the main programs in question.  Often the .DLL files are already installed on the system.  When these files are in use, they may not be updateable until the next reboot.
<P>
Setup has two phases - first it copies in a few files necessary for setup to run and then (usually) reboots.
