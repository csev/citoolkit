You must extract this information into a directory in your web hierarchy called 
<b>Community</b> which will appear as 
<b> http://localhost/community/</b>. In a standard configuration this would be
<b> C:\InetPub\wwwroot\Community\</b> with the appropriate drive letter.
In this example, you should extract to <b> C:\InetPub\wwwroot\</b>.  The <b> Community\ </b> 
is part of the file name stored in the ZIP.
