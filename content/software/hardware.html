    <H3>Software</H3>

    <P>The toolkit project software will require/run on the following
    software:</P>

    <UL>
      <LI><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/ntserver/">Microsoft Windows
      NT 4.0</A>
      <LI><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/iis/">Microsoft Internet
      Information Server (IIS)</A>
      
      <LI><A HREF="http://www.activeserverpages.com/">Microsoft Active
      Server Pages</A>
      <LI>(Optional) <A HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vinterdev/">Microsoft
      Visual Interdev</A>
      <LI>(Optional) <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/frontpage/">Microsoft FrontPage98</A>
    </UL>

    <H3>Minimum Server Hardware</H3>

    <P>The minimum hardware configuration required to support this
    software is as follows:</P>

    <UL>
      <LI>Pentium-II 300Mhz
      <LI>64MB RAM
      <LI>4GB Hard Disk
      <LI>CD-ROM
      <LI>10/100 PCI-based Ethernet card
    </UL>

    <P>You will need to add an NT supported backup option to this
    hardware. We do not recommend anything below a Digital Audio
    Tape backup system connected using a SCSI controller. Other backup
    hardware (such as a Travan style tape or CD-ROM Writer) may work
    well enough for your purposes with some additional effort.</P>

    <P>&nbsp;</P>

    <H3>New Server Hardware</H3>

    <P>If a server is specifically being purchased for this project,
    the following hardware is recommended:</P>

    <UL>
      <LI>Pentium-II 300Mhz (Or higher)
      <LI>128MB RAM
      <LI>4GB Hard Disk (Either SCSI or Ultra DMA IDE)
      <LI>12GB Digital Audio Tape (DDS-3) Backup (SCSI Connection)
      <LI>CD-ROM Reader (SCSI or IDE)
      <LI>CD-ROM Writer (SCSI Connection) (optional)
      <LI>10/100 PCI-based Ethernet card
    </UL>

    <P>It is possible to order this type of system pre-configured
    with this equipment. </P>

    <P>Completely configured systems meeting the minimum specification
    can be bought for under $5000. If your server is configured as
    a &quot;server&quot; class machine, it will usually include Ultra-SCSI
    disk and the option for arrays of disks, both of which improve
    performance for high-volume Web sites. Server class machines
    provide greater expandability and in some cases are designed
    to be less prone to failure. Costs of server class machines can
    range from $5000 to $10,000 or more.</P>

    <H3>Network</H3>

    <UL>
      <LI>Permanent, direct connection to the Internet
      <LI>Connection speed dependent on volume and complexity of information
      transferred
    </UL>
