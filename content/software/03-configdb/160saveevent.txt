In this, we see the <b>Event Type</b> and <b>Audience Type</b>.  These will only appear if they are enabled in the site configuration.

We also see the three locally customizable fields.  We have not yet set these so they are blank.

When done, press <b>Save Event</b> and you will be taken back to the main events menu.
