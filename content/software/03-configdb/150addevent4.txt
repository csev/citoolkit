URL fields allow you to specify a URL for the event.  These are not checked for accuracy in any way.  They appear when the user requests more detail.

The <b>URL Name for Addtl Info</b> field is not a URL - it is the text which appears as the hypertext link for the additional information URL.  A simple way to use this would be to set it to "click here".  You probably will come up with a more creative use of it.  You could actually make it an <b>img</b> tag.  Just make sure to close the tag.
