<h3>Managing Users</h3>
In this exercise, we look at how users are added and managed in the system.  The purpose of allowing multiple users is the delegation of responsibility and the granting of permissions and access.
<P>
Some example uses of these features:
<ul>
<li>Create an account to post to a forum
<li>Create an account which can only add events
<li>Use multiple accounts to implement an event approval process
<li>Create multiple sub-administrators
</ul>

We will type in the basic information about the user.  This is helpful when you are trying to track someone down in a hurry.  It is much easier to get this <i>before</i> you have created the account rather than later.

This is the second half of the new user form.  It is a good idea to include an expire date even if it is somewhat in the future.
<P>
<b>Last Logon Date</b>, <b>Last Logon Attempt</b> and <b>Failed Logons</b> are used to track accounts to lock them in case someone is trying to break in.  The failed logons value tells how many <i>consecutive</i> bad logon attempts have occurred.  When the system-wide threshold has been reached, the account is locked and the user cannot log-in.
<P>
To unlock an account, an administrator must come to this screen and uncheck this field and update the account.
<P>
You type the password twice to make sure it matches.

There are many roles which the user can perform.  If you add them all, then this account is another administrator account.
<P>
The list of roles is as follows:
<ul>
<li>Add Events
<li>Approve Events
<li>Delete Events
<li>Edit Events
<li>Participate in a forum
<li>Moderate Forums
<li>Manage Forums
<li>Administer the Site
</ul>
<P>
Multiple roles can be selected using the <b>shift</b> or <b>control</b> keys.
<P>
In this example, we will only allow our user to <b>Add Events</b>.

And indeed our event has made it.

This shows how one particular task can be given to a user without giving them full administration capabilities.

Next we will do a short example demonstrating the event approval process.

Now we go back to <b>Home</b>, log in as <b>millsa</b>, go to <b>Manage Events</b> and add a new event.  Then we go to <b>Home</b> and check the calendar.

Now go back to <b>Home</b>, then to <b>Administration</b>, and log in as <b>admin</b>.

Going back to the calendar, we see that the event has appeared.

In this exercise, we have briefly explored how user accounts are created and managed.
<P>
Each organization will be different in how they want to delegate authority in their database.  Hopefully, this system is reasonably flexible and easy to use for your needs.
