There are many roles which the user can perform.  If you add them all, then this account is another administrator account.

The list of roles is as follows:
<ul>
<li>Add Events
<li>Approve Events
<li>Delete Events
<li>Edit Events
<li>Participate in a forum
<li>Moderate Forums
<li>Manage Forums
<li>Administer the Site
</ul>

Multiple roles can be selected using the <b>shift</b> or <b>control</b> keys.  

In this example, we will only allow our user to <b>Add Events</b>.
