<ul>
<li>Windows NT Version 4.0
<li>IIS 4.0
<li>You will need an updated version of the JSCRIPT library.  This can
be done by upgrading
you scripting library from 
<a href=http://msdn.microsoft.com/scripting/default.htm>
http://msdn.microsoft.com/scripting/default.htm
</a> - (as of the writing of this documentation)

</ul>
Please install these tools before starting.
<h3>Code</h3>
The following is the code provided:
<ul>
<li>
<a href=commasp-v1.zip>Toolkit ASP Source Code</a> - To be installed
<li>
<a href=admin-v1.zip>Toolkit Administrator</a> - To be installed
<li>
<a href=adminsrc-v1.zip>Toolkit Administrator Source</a> 
(Not part of installation process)
</ul>
<h3>Installation Instructions</h3>
If you need more detail, this process is documented in tutorial fashion in:
<ul>
<li><a href=01-instasp/index.htm>Installing the Toolkit Software</a>
<li><a href=02-runadmin/index.htm>Running the Toolkit Administrator</a>
</ul>
Steps to take:
<ul>
<li>Uninstall previous versions of the toolkit if installed - The software provides
an uninstall option under <b> Start | Settings | Control Panel | Add/Remove Programs</b>
<li>Unzip the <a href=commasp-v1.zip>Toolkit ASP Source Code</a>  into a directory in your web hierarchy called 
<b>Community</b> which will appear as 
<b> http://localhost/community/</b> In a standard configuration this would be
<b> C:\InetPub\wwwroot\Community\</b> with the appropriate drive letter.
<li>
Now we will alter some settings in your web configuration.
<b> Start | Programs | Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack | 
Microsoft Internet Information Server | Internet Service Manager </b>
Then select <b>Internet Information Server</b>, <b>www</b> (or other host name),
and the <b> Default Web Site</b>.  Once you open the <b> Default Web Site</b>
you should see a list of files, directories, webs, and virtual directories.
Navigate down until you find <b>community</b>.  Right click on <b>community</b> 
and select <b>Properties</b>.  Under the <b>Directory</b> tab in Properties,
first press <b> Create </b> under <b> Application Settings</b>.  
Also select <b>Run in separate memory space</b>.  This increases the overall
reliability of your web server.  Also de-select <b>Index this Directory</b>
and <b>Directory Browsing Allowed</b> if they are set.  When this 
is completed press <b>Apply</b> and <b>OK</b>.  
Under the <b> Documents </b> tab add <b> index.asp </b> as a default document.

<li>Then unzip the <a href=admin-v1.zip>Toolkit Administrator</a> into a temporary directory and
run <b> setup.exe </b>  If you are running locally with the toolkit CD-ROM, 
click <a href=adminsetup/setup.exe>here</a>.

<li>This setup will be a two-step process.  The first step
will install some DLL files and may need a reboot.  
The second step looks more like a traditional setup.
If the setup seems to be unable to update existing files, simply
write down the files and skip them.  Chances are good that they are not being updated.
A setup package always contains a number of DLL's just to make sure that the DLL's are
on your system.  This package does not contain any critical DLL upgrades so if
you already have a DLL, there is no pressing need to update it.  So feel free to press 
<b>Ignore</b> or <b>Skip</b> for any of the standard Microsoft DLL files.
<li>
If you have not already done so,
you will need to update the JSCRIPT library by installing the latest
versions of Microsoft scripting.  This can be done from 
<a href=http://msdn.microsoft.com/scripting/default.htm>
http://msdn.microsoft.com/scripting/default.htm
</a>  - You may also have to stop your web server for this installation
as well.
<li>
Execute the Calendar Administrator 
under <b> Start | Programs | Community Toolkit | Administration Tool</b>.  
There is on-line documentation
available under <b>Help</b>.
<li>
You goal is to add a database.  To do this you need a long name and
a short name.
The long name is for a human to read - for example "Wiggins Public Library".  
The short name is used to create several files - for example "rww".  
The press <b> Add Library</b>.  After some machinations, it should add
a DSN called <b>ctk_rww</b>, a database file called <b>rww.mdb</b>, 
and four .asp files.
<li>
When this is complete,
the following URLS will exist:
<pre>
http://localhost/community/start/index.asp
http://localhost/community/start/rww.asp
http://localhost/community/start/rww-admin.asp
http://localhost/community/start/rww-calendar.asp
http://localhost/community/start/rww-forum.asp
</pre>
(With "rww" replaced with the "short" name you chose).
These URLS can be embedded in your other pages to jump to 
the selector page, admin page, calendar page, and forum page 
respectively.  
<li>The first step is to go to the admin page and get things set-up.  The administrator
account is "admin" and whatever password you set during library creation.
</ul>
