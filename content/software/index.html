    <P>The Toolkit includes demonstration applications and comprehensive
    installation documentation so as to  assist community information
    networks in deploying servers and software for new projects.
    For the purposes of the demonstration applications, the Toolkit
    assumes a Windows-NT server environment and provides basic tools
    to help users in this environment. This assistance is in two
    basic areas:</P>

    <UL>
      <LI>Documentation that shows how to install and configure a web
      server on Windows-NT
      <LI>Software written in Active Server Pages (ASP) which implements
      a web-based community calendar and community forum discussion
      tool
    </UL>

    <P>Sites should give careful thought to the decision to install
    and support a server. Sites unsure of whether or not to install
    a server should consult the &quot;Supporting a Server&quot; chapter
    in the Toolkit book and view the video titled &quot;Running a
    Web Server&quot;.</P>

    <P>Once you have decided to run a server, this section should
    be very helpful in getting started. Before starting the installation
    process, check to make sure your equipment meets the <A HREF="hardware.html"
    TARGET="_new">Minimum Hardware Recommendations</A>.<B><FONT SIZE="-2"

    <P><IMG SRC="overview-software-usingdoc.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" BORDER="0"
    NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALT="Sample Software Documentation Screen Shot"
    WIDTH="305" HEIGHT="218">The documentation provided includes
    comprehensive, step-by-step explanations. Each step consists
    of a screen shot with annotation explaining what the step entails.
    Each of the embedded screen images is a hyperlink to a full-screen
    rendition of that screen shot. Click on the small screen image
    to see the screen shot full-size. When you are done looking at
    that screen shot and ready to go to the next step, use your browser's
    Back button to return to your spot in the narrative.</P>

    <P><A HREF="../nt/index.htm" TARGET="_new"><IMG SRC="ntinstall.gif"
    ALIGN="RIGHT" BORDER="0" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="123" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A>The
    Toolkit documentation covers the complete installation of Windows-NT
    starting from the floppy disks and the CD-ROM all the way through
    installing and testing your web server. Each step is documented
    with a screen shot and description of the actions and choices
    for the user.</P>

    process. <BR CLEAR="ALL"></P>

    <H3>Toolkit Application Software</H3>

    <P>The Toolkit application software implements a database-driven
    community calendar and a community discussion forum. The software
    is written as an Active Server Pages application, and the source
    code (original programming code, suitable for editing if you
    wish) is included. The software has been designed to be usable
    without any modifications for simple to moderately complex sites.
    By providing the source code, it is hoped that a community of
    users and developers will help to support and extend the product.</P>
