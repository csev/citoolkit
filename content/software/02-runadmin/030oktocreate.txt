To enhance security, the database files are not stored in the web-accessible part of the hierarchy.  In this example, we use <b>C:\InetPub\databases\community\</b> as the directory for the databases.  The first database you create will cause the directory to be created.  You will not get this prompt for the second and following databases.

There is no reason that all the databases need to be in the same directory.

<h2>Please, Please, Please backup this directory</h2>
(and when you don't, and you lose the hard disk the data is simply gone)
