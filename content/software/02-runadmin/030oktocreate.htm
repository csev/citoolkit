To enhance security, the database files are not stored in the web-accessible part of the hierarchy.  In this example, we use <b>C:\InetPub\databases\community\</b> as the directory for the databases.  The first database you create will cause the directory to be created.  You will not get this prompt for the second and following databases.
<P>
There is no reason that all the databases need to be in the same directory.
<P>
<h2>Please, Please, Please backup this directory</h2>
(and when you don't, and you lose the hard disk the data is simply gone)
