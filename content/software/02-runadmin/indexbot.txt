This tutorial walks you through the toolkit administration tool.  It does a rather simple but important set of tasks in the overall scheme of things.  To run this tool, you must be physically on the server.  This is necessary for security reasons.

Up next, we will do a brief walkthrough on using the toolkit software.  We will set up a database, enter an event and view the events.
