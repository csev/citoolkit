<!-- file:100testasp-->
This is the contents of the <b>test.asp</b>. As you can see it is a rather short file, setting some session variables and redirecting the user to another file.  The most important value is the <b>ConnectionString</b> value which links this (and other) ASP file(s) to the proper system DSN.  It is this value which allows many databases to be used with this software.

If you get tricky (say by trying to use SQL Server), you should only have to edit these files to get the ODBC connection properly set up.
