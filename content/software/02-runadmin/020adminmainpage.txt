This is the main start page for the program.  There is on-line documentation under <b>Help</b>.

Each database has a <b>Long Name</b> (descriptive) and a <b>short name</b> (used to make files and URLs).

In this example, we set the long name to <b>A Test Library</b> and the short name 
to <b>test</b>.

To create a database, we press <b>Add Database</b>. After some machinations, it should add
a DSN called <b>ctk_test</b>, a database file called <b>test.mdb</b>, 
and four .asp files.  As the last step, it will prompt you for an administrator password for the database.

See the help file for more detail on what this tool can do.
