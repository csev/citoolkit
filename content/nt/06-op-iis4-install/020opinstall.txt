<!-- file:020opinstall-->
This install takes three steps because there are prerequisites to IIS 4.0.
<ul>
<li>Install Service Pack 3 for NT (Later for Y2K we will go to Service Pack 4)
<li>Install Internet Explorer 4.0
<li>Install IIS 4.0
</ul>
So you launch each in turn by navigating to the CD-ROM.  The installs are done from a web browser.
