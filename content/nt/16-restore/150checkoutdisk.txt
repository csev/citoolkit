We come back up, log in and take a look at the disks.  Now we have both <b> WINNT</b> and an <b>XYZNT</b>.  But because we rebooted, everything in WINNT is active and the XYZNT data can be removed.
<p>
Simply highlight <b> XYZNT </b> and press <b>Shift-Delete</b>.  We don't even want to bother putting this into the recycle bin.
