The parameters on this first restore (we will do 2) are important to get right.
<p>
Select <b> Restore Local Registry </b> and unselect <b> Restore File Permissions</b>.
The reason is that because we do not have the security configured
(the configuration is still on the tape).  
Restoring permissions under an invalid security scheme is pretty pointless.
<p>
The <b>Verify</b> option is up to you.
