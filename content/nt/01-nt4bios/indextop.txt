<h2>Working with the BIOS</h2>
Typically, during the boot sequence you can press a key or key sequence
 to cause the boot process to be diverted into the CMOS configuration.  
CMOS contains stored configuration regarding how the system is to be booted.  
This information is stored in battery-backed up RAM so you do not need to make 
these changes each time the power is turned on.  The settings available and
the procedures for manipulating these settings vary widely between manufacturers.  
Some use graphical interfaces and others use simple text based interfaces.


A system administrator should not be afraid of CMOS settings.  
Before putting a system into production, they need to know the 
proper settings in case the stored settings are lost.  
Often, there is a "reset-to-factory-default"
option which may or may not result in the proper settings for your system.
