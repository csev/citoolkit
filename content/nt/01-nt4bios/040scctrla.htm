In this example, we have an Adaptec 2940UW SCSI disk controller.  Generally, SCSI controllers have their own BIOS which which allows the operating system to boot from SCSI devices.  This BIOS may also have a configuration option.  In this example, pressing CTRL-A at the right moment will interrupt the standard boot sequence and enter a SCSI diagnostic and configuration utility.
