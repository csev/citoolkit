This is the main screen for one particular CMOS setting for the M6TBA Biostar Motherboard used in these examples.  This is an example of a "non-graphical" interface.  It allows you to control a wide range of settings.  The most common settings which need to be manipulated are in the "Standard CMOS Setup" area.

The more modern (Pentium-II) systems tend to have more forgiving requirements for BIOS settings.  For example, in 386 and some 486 systems, you had to set the precise disk drive configuration into the CMOS.  Most modern CMOS setting can automatically detect disk drive geometry.
