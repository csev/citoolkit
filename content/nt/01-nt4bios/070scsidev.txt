In the SCSI disk utility, all of the SCSI IDs are scanned and it reports the devices attached to the controller.  In this example, we have a disk at 3, tape at 6, and the controller is at 7.  You should not attach a peripheral to SCSI with a SCSI ID of 7.    You can also low-level format a disk from this menu.  There is very seldom a good reason to low-level format a SCSI disk.  However, if you suspect hardware problems, if a low level format fails, then either (1) the disk is bad (2) the cables are bad (3) the cables or controller is not properly seated, or (4) the controller is bad.

Make sure to check the cables and seating of the card before declaring the disk bad.  Especially when you have done some hardware work in the system.
