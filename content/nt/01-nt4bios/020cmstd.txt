This shows the more common BIOS settings. They include the date and time and the IDE disk drive configuration.  Because this is a SCSI system, we have no IDE  hard drives.  In 486 and earlier computers, you often had to know a "drive number".  In more recent IDE arrangements there is an "auto-detect" of the drive geometry.  This BIOS even has a diagnostic mode where it will query the IDE drives and report the drive geometry.  The drive geometry only applies to hard drives.  CD-ROMs and drives like ZIP’s generally do not need any drive geometry settings.
