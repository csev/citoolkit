<!-- file:040needadmin-->
To create a new web we need Administrator permission.  Once the web is created we will delegate the permission to edit the web to a non-administrator account.
<p>
If you would like to allow other accounts to create and administer webs, use the FrontPage Server Administrator on the NT server.
