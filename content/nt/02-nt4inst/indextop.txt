<h2>Initial setup of NT from floppy disk</h2>
The first step in installing Windows NT is to boot from the setup floppies.  Insert Setup Disk 1 and boot the system.  If you are using a SCSI CD-ROM drive, you can insert the Windows NT Server CD in the CD-ROM and boot.

The sequence is essentially the same from the CD or floppies except for the lack of any prompts for the floppy disks when coming from the CD.

When this exercise is complete, the system will be rebooted and setup will continue in a graphical mode.
