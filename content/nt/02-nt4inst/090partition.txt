<!-- file:090partition-->
Given that we are starting from scratch, we must partition the disk.  In our example, we will ultimately create two partitions on the disk.
<ul>
<li>A C: partition for software
<li>A D: partition for data
</ul>
By separating these we can separately backup and restore our data and operating system.  It is not required that you separate these, but it is recommended.

You also might encounter this screen in the process of rebuilding a system.  In that case you may need to delete and recreate partitions.  Each situation will be different.

We press <B>C</B> to create a new partition.
