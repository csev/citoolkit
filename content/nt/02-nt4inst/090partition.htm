Given that we are starting from scratch, we must partition the disk.  In our example, we will ultimately create two partitions on the disk.
<ul>
<li>A C: partition for software
<li>A D: partition for data
</ul>
By separating these we can separately backup and restore our data and operating system.  It is not required that you separate these, but it is recommended.
<p>
You also might encounter this screen in the process of rebuilding a system.  In that case you may need to delete and recreate partitions.  Each situation will be different.
<p>
We press <B>C</B> to create a new partition.
