At this point NT has absolutely no idea what hardware is installed on your system.  It needs to autodetect the hardware which is installed.  This will take a few minutes.  NT will load a lot of different drivers to see if those drivers can auto detect the hardware.  As part of the process it will prompt you for disk 3 which contains the drivers.
