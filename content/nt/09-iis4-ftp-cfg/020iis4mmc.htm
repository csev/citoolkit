The <b> Microsoft Management Console </b> is new in this release of IIS.  The MMC is designed to provide a generic, extensible way to manage all kinds of areas of the system.  The MMC has "snap-ins" which are pieces of software which extend the MMC.
<p>
We have the Internet Information Server and Microsoft Transaction Server "snap-ins".
