First test the networking.  Use the <b>ping</b> command to ping a known IP address.
<p>
If ping does not work, you are in bad shape.  You need to diagnose this problem.  This would be a good time to use a working system connected to the same network to run ping and compare results.  Try pinging another system on the LAN in addition to trying to ping
systems across the Internet.

Another useful command to diagnose networking is <b> tracert</b>.
