Congratulations, you are logged in to your brand new NT system.
<p>
At this point, you should also wait a few moments to let the disk activity subside.  You may see more dialog boxes.

If by this point you have not seen any dialog boxes, you are in pretty good shape.
But before we get too happy, we should do a little testing.
