Check the event log under
<b> Start | Programs | Administrative Tools (Common) | Event Viewer</b>.
<p>
The event log is a very useful tool - if you had any problems during boot, you may be able to get additional details in the event log.
<p>
The event log can also help you identify security problems and a number of other system problems.
<p>
Events are coded in the event log by a color code.  Blue events are for your information only.  In a later exercise we will see some "non-blue" events.
