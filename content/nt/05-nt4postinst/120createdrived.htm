The CD-ROM has been moved to E: so we can assign a drive letter to the unassigned space on our hard drive.  Use right-click and select <b>Create</b> to create a partition.
<p>
Note: We could have simply made this the E: drive and saved some effort.  But this approach leads us to demonstrate a few other techniques.  Feel free to simply make this the E: drive in your installation.  But then a few things will be slightly different later in the tutorial.
