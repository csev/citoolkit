Type in the name and account for the new user.  Set the initial password (twice).
<p>
Also, uncheck the "Change password at next log-in".  If this user is to use FTP only, they have no way to change their password and this will prevent them from using FTP.
<p>
You may want to create some groups and use those groups to control who can and cannot use various services.  This tutorial will not cover those techniques.
