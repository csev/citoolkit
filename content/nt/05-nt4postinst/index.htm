<h2>Configuring the Running System</h2>
Now the system is up and has passed some basic tests.  In this exercise, we begin to configure the system and walk through some system administration tasks including:
<ul>
<li>Create a User Account
<li>Set Security Policies (The defaults are wide-open)
<li>Format the <b>D:</b> partition
<li>Use <b> regedit </b> to edit the registry
</ul>
In a later exercise we will see a simpler way to create and format the <B>D:</b>
partition without using <b> regedit</b>.  Using <b> regedit</b> is included in this exercise as an example.

The first of our post-installation tasks is to create a user account.
<p>
Use
<b>Start | Program | Administrative Tools (Common) | User Manager</b>.
Within User Manager run <B> User | New User</b>.

<!-- file:020newuser-->
Type in the name and account for the new user.  Set the initial password (twice).
<p>
Also, uncheck the "Change password at next log-in".  If this user is to use FTP only, they have no way to change their password and this will prevent them from using FTP.
<p>
You may want to create some groups and use those groups to control who can and cannot use various services.  This tutorial will not cover those techniques.

Some system administrators suggest that you rename the <b>Administrator</b> account.  This makes it slightly harder for a hacker to gain administrator access to your system.
<p>
This step is optional.  It is found in User manager under <b> User | Rename</b>.
<p>
P.S. the name used in this example "root" - is just about as bad - so choose another administrator account name

You need to set some account policies.  These can be found under
<b> Policies | Account</b>.  The default settings are probably too lenient.

The settings shown here are probably more typical.  (You may have to click on the image to enlarge it)

<!-- file:050userrights-->
Under <b> Policy | User Rights</b>, you can change a variety of the rights that various users can have.  By default these are pretty lenient.
You may want to restrict these somewhat.  This would be a good reason to create a group called "Network Users" (see User | New Local Group ) and then individually add those users to this group that you are willing to have come in over the network.  Then under User Rights, only the Administrators and Network User groups would be allowed to come in over the network.
<p>
To increase security, you might want to indicate that administrators can not come in over the network.  But you will then need physical access to the system to do many of the administrative chores.  Much of a security design is a balance between convienence and airtight security.

Next we will make some disk adjustments which include creating a D: partition. This is done by running

The CD-ROM has been moved to E: so we can assign a drive letter to the unassigned space on our hard drive.  Use right-click and select <b>Create</b> to create a partition.
<p>
Note: We could have simply made this the E: drive and saved some effort.  But this approach leads us to demonstrate a few other techniques.  Feel free to simply make this the E: drive in your installation.  But then a few things will be slightly different later in the tutorial.

Now that we are done making and moving disks, there is a little clean-up.  The registry still believes that we installed NT from the <b>D:</b> drive. We just moved the CD-ROM to the E: drive.  We need to clean up this little mess or we will keep getting dialogs as we reconfigure NT and it needs little bits of information off the CD.  It just means that we need to use Browse each time.  But this is inconvenient.  And it gives us a good excuse to use <b>regedit</b>.
<p>
<b>Warning:</b>
Regedit is the system administrator's friend and enemy.  It is the entire configuration of NT - so you can fix anything or break anything.  So be careful.
<p>
To run RegEdit, use
<b> Start | Run | regedit | OK</b>.
<p>
P.S.  If we had formatted our new disk space as E:, we would not have to do this step.  Later in another exercise we will show a different technique for creating the C and D drives.

Then you are presented a dialog box to change the value.  Carefully change the D: to E: and press OK.  Then press <b>F3</b> to search for the next occurrence.  When it is found change that value until you have caught all the values.
<p>
There should be about 5 values which match "D:" after a fresh install.  This procedure will not work so well after a wide range of other software packages are installed.
<p>
Once this is all done, it would be a good time for a reboot and a quick test of the disk drives, CD-ROM and networking.
