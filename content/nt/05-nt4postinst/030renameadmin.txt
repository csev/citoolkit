Some system administrators suggest that you rename the <b>Administrator</b> account.  This makes it slightly harder for a hacker to gain administrator access to your system.
<p>
This step is optional.  It is found in User manager under <b> User | Rename</b>.

P.S. the name used in this example "root" - is just about as bad - so choose another administrator account name
