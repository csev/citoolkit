<h2>Installing Visual Interdev 6.0 and FrontPage98</h2>
This exercise shows how to install Visual Interdev and FrontPage.  The assumption is that you are installing these tools on a "client" system and not on the server.  Throughout the dialog, we talk of "client" and "server".

If you only have one system, you can install these tools on the server.  They will work fine on the server.  However unless you have a good reason to put them on the server, it is best to leave them off.  The less things to go wrong on the server, the better.
