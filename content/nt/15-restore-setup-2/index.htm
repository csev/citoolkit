<h2>Minimal NT Installation - Part 2</h2>
Continuing with our restore exercise, we have rebooted after the initial floppy-based setup.
First the system boots and converts the file system from FAT to NTFS.  Then the system
reboots again and performs the graphical setup and configuration.
<P>
Because we only need a subset of NT to work to access the tapes, this procedure is somewhat abbreviated compared to the first exercise.  We don't even install networking support.
<P>
We partition the disks slightly differently than in the earlier exercise.  This technique is the better approach than the approach used in the first installation.

The system reboots and the initial NT screen shows up.  The delay is set to zero so it immediately continues the boot.
<p>
NT Setup formats the C: as a FAT filesystem but on this reboot it gets converted to NTFS as part of the boot process. This conversion does not take much time.  Then the system gets rebooted again.

Next, the Graphical setup executes and copies still more information from the CD-ROM to the hard disk.
<p>
Once the copy is complete setup says, "hello" and you press <b>Next</b>

This screen is asking the nature of your network connection.  Since this is a temporary installation, we will not bother to set up any form of networking.
<p>
However if the restore needs the network, you will have to install and configure networking.

Now you are asked to restart the computer.  Now we have a "minimal" functional NT installation.  All that just to talk to a tape drive.
<p>
This might be a good time to remind you that some third party backup solutions (read $$) have a floppy based restore which is much cleaner than this multi-step process.
<p>
But ah well - think of how much you have learned.  With that in mind, we proceed on our quest to  get our long-lost data back.
