<h2>Minimal NT Installation - Part 2</h2>
Continuing with our restore exercise, we have rebooted after the initial floppy-based setup.
First the system boots and converts the file system from FAT to NTFS.  Then the system
reboots again and performs the graphical setup and configuration.

Because we only need a subset of NT to work to access the tapes, this procedure is somewhat abbreviated compared to the first exercise.  We don't even install networking support.

We partition the disks slightly differently than in the earlier exercise.  This technique is the better approach than the approach used in the first installation.
