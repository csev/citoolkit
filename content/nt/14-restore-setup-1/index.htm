<H2>Minimal NT Install - Part 1</h2>
In this exercise, we are going to destroy a perfectly good working system and restore it from tape.
<p>
To access the tape, we must perform a minimal install, and then reload the tapes.
There are subtle differences between our minimal installation and a standard installation. Those differences will be noted as we go through the exercise.
<p>
Like the initial installation, this installation is broken into two parts.  The first part is the non-graphical installation from the floppies (or SCSI CD-ROM) and the second part is the graphical installation and configuration of the system.

To start the process of installing NT, place setup disk 1 into the floppy drive and reboot the system.  After a few moments it will prompt you for setup disk 2.  Insert the disk and press <b>Enter</b>.

This is the welcome screen for setup.  This is a very important screen. Even though we are "restoring", we are currently doing a fresh install so we simply press enter.

At this point NT has absolutely no idea what hardware is installed on your system.  It needs to autodetect the hardware which is installed.  This will take a few minutes.  NT will load a lot of different drivers to see if those drivers can auto detect the hardware.  As part of the process it will prompt you for disk 3 which contains the drivers.  Insert disk 3 and press enter.

In this example, it has found an Adaptec SCSI controller and an IDE controller.  Because the CD-ROM is connected via IDE, it will load the drivers for IDE.
<P>
Assuming that there are no other storage drivers needed, generally click on <B>Enter</b>
to continue.

Because this is a completely configured system, we see two partitions (C: and D:).  Even though it seems a terrible waste - first, we must delete these partitions.  (Remember it is for science and education)
<p>
Select the first partition and press <b>D</b>.

Now we have a "brand new" disk.  Unlike the first time we installed NT, we will create both the <b>C:</b> and the <b>D:</b>  partitions on the disk at this time.
<p>
You will find this approach makes things much simpler later.  The drive letters will be correct from the beginning and the steps need to format <b>D:</b> will be much simpler.  We did it the other way in the first exercise as an example.
We press <B>C</B> to create a new partition.

It computes the remaining size available on the disk as a default.  We accept the default and press <b>Enter</b>.  Because this will be formatted later using the <b>Disk Administration</b> utility, it does not have to be less than 2GB.
<p>
Recall that the <b>C:</b> partition is initially formatted as FAT and converted to NTFS as part of a later Setup step.

Once the copying is finished, you  will reboot the system so that you can continue to setup Windows-NT with the graphical interface.
<p>
Make sure to remove the setup floppies.
