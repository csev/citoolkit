Once the tape has been loaded, select the C drive, check <b> Verify </b> and <b> Backup Registry</b>.
<p>
If your drive supports it, select <b> Hardware Compression</b>
<p>
Then press <b> OK </b> to start the backup.
<p>
While you wait for the tape to spin, you should add an entry to your backup log.  Later when the system has crashed, you won't want to spend hours scanning tapes to try and figure out which is/are the most "recent" tape(s).
