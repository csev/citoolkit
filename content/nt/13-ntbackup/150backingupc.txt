<!-- file:150backingupc-->
During the backup, the backup program may encounter an open file which it cannot backup.  It waits for 25 seconds to see if it can get the file and then continues without including the file.  By stopping the services, we avoid most of these messages.  However, there may still be several files open which do not get backed up. 
<p>
Make sure to check the backup log by scrolling back when the backup is complete to determine if the files are essential at restore time.
