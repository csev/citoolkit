<!-- file:160verifyingc-->
After the backup is complete the tape will be rewound and the verify will be performed.
<p>
Verify reads the tape, and for each file on the tape checks to see if it matches the disk copy of the file.  Verify will <i>not</i> detect missing files.  You must scroll through the backup log to find missing files.
