Update Repair Info copies critical system configuration information into a directory called <b> C:\WINNT\REPAIR</B>.  We do this so the repair information gets copied onto our backups.  In a moment this information will also be copied onto a floppy disk as well.

This repair information contains the accounts and password for the system so the repair floppy and backup tapes need to be kept in a physically secure location.
