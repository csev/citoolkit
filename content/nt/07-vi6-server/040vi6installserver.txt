In this step we will be installing the server components of Visual Interdev. 
The server installation will add a few features
and update a few components within IIS 4.0.

If you have not yet installed IIS 4.0, this procedure will do a complete install of IIS 4.0 as well.  In the example we are showing here IIS 4.0 has already been installed.

You may also encounter a message which says that VI 6.0 has not been tested to work with Service Pack 4.0.  While only Microsoft can tell you that Service Pack 4 and VI 6.0 will 
work fine together, it is a pretty safe bet that there will be no problems.

That is a good reason to install the software and apply the service pack last.  Hopefully, the service pack is the most up-to-date and is aware of any problems.
