You are allowed to specify the number of users your license covers.  There are two ways of licensing NT.  You can either license a number of connected users or have a license for each system ("seat") connected to any NT server.  The first choice makes most sense for a standalone server like a web server.  The second choice makes the best sense for a large enterprise-network.
<p>
In a sense, if you don't know the answer to this question, then most likely you should choose the first choice.
<p>
In terms of the total number of users, that is part of your license.  Even though you can set this number to any value - make sure to set it to the proper number for your license.
