You need to set up the domain name information for your system.  There are three components to this:
<ul>
<li>The Internet name for this system <b> www </b> (This is the same as the Computer Name for Windows Networking)
<li>The domain name suffix for this system (toolkit.net in this example) - this should be available from your network administrator.  The name for the computer on the Internet will be <b> www.toolkit.net</b>.
<li>The address (IP) of the domain name server which can be used to resolve (look-up) domain name addresses
</ul>
Once these are set, press <b>OK</b>
