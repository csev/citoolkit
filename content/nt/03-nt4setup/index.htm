<h2>Continued Setup in Graphical Mode</h2>
Windows NT setup does as little of its setup as possible during the first phase.  After the first phase is done, the system is rebooted from the hard disk.  The first task is to convert the FAT formatted file system to NTFS.  Then the system is rebooted again and a graphical user interface is used to continue setup.
<P>
When this exercise is complete, the system will be rebooted and NT will be up.

The system reboots and the initial NT screen shows up.  The delay is set to zero so it immediately continues the boot.

Setup formats the C: as a FAT filesystem but on the first reboot it gets converted to NTFS as part of the boot process. This conversion does not take much time.

You are allowed to specify the number of users your license covers.  There are two ways of licensing NT.  You can either license a number of connected users or have a license for each system ("seat") connected to any NT server.  The first choice makes most sense for a standalone server like a web server.  The second choice makes the best sense for a large enterprise-network.
<p>
In a sense, if you don't know the answer to this question, then most likely you should choose the first choice.
<p>
In terms of the total number of users, that is part of your license.  Even though you can set this number to any value - make sure to set it to the proper number for your license.

Now you specify the computer name.  To keep your life simple, we suggest that his name should be used both for the Windows networking name for the computer and for the TCP/IP domain name for the computer.
<p>
For example, on the local area network, this computer will be known as <B>WWW</B> in the
<B>TOOLKIT</b> workgroup (we will set the workgroup name later).  On the Internet, the computer will be named <b> www.toolkit.net</b> (we will set the domain suffix later).
<p>
Having these two computer names the same is a good idea.  As Microsoft seems to be embracing TCP/IP and the Internet domain name system, in the future this might even be a better idea.
<p>
If you are skilled, feel free to make these names different.

Now we select the server type.  The answer to this is simple.
If you are already running a domain then you probably are an experienced administrator and are not reading this documentation.
<p>
In most instances you will choose <b>Standalone server</b>.  It is not a good idea to run your web server on your primary or backup domain controller.  There are lots of reasons for this - two good ones are performance and security.

This is a good time to remind you that this system is a server and you should avoid installing lots of little "workstation" gadgets.  The simpler the better on a server system.  (Just tell your boss to get you a decent desktop - it is necessary to keep the servers reliable.  Also tell your boss that your high performance desktop can be used as hardware backup for the server.   What boss could say "no" to that logic.)

<P>
The suggestion is to de-select NWLink and select NetBEUI.

DHCP is a protocol which allows systems to be assigned IP addresses dynamically at boot time from a DHCP server.  It is generally not a good idea for a web server to have a DHCP provided address.
