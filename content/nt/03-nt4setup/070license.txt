You are allowed to specify the number of users your license covers.  There are two ways of licensing NT.  You can either license a number of connected users or have a license for each system ("seat") connected to any NT server.  The first choice makes most sense for a standalone server like a web server.  The second choice makes the best sense for a large enterprise-network.

In a sense, if you don't know the answer to this question, then most likely you should choose the first choice.

In terms of the total number of users, that is part of your license.  Even though you can set this number to any value - make sure to set it to the proper number for your license.
