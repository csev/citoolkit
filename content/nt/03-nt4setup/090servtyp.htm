Now we select the server type.  The answer to this is simple.
If you are already running a domain then you probably are an experienced administrator and are not reading this documentation.

In most instances you will choose <b>Standalone server</b>.  It is not a good idea to run your web server on your primary or backup domain controller.  There are lots of reasons for this - two good ones are performance and security.
