<h2>Installing the Y2K Service Pack</h2>
Next we will download and install portions of Service Pack 4.  We need to do this to get some Y2K fixes.  You should consult the Microsoft web site to see if there are additional Y2K patches or service packs at the time you are installing the system.
<P>
First we download the service pack, then extract it and install two of the four components contained in the service pack.
<P>
It is important to remember that for a system to be Y2K compliant, both the hardware and the software must be Y2K compliant.

Microsoft reorganizes their www.microsoft.com site regularly.  But in general, look for "Downloads", "Service Pack", or "Support".  Service packs are very commonly accessed items so they are generally pretty easy to find.

When you request to download the service pack, Microsoft will use your IP address to determine whether or not you are downloading the information from North America.  Sometimes this procedure is problematic.  If you experience problems, try it at least twice before giving up.

Save this file in a directory that you will likely keep.  Some administrators use a subdirectory under Program Files called
<b>C:\Program Files\KeepZips</b>.  You may have to reinstall this service pack from time to time, so it is a good idea to keep the service pack around.

Then the files will be extracted.  Interestingly, most service packs auto install at this point.  This particular service pack requires us to hand execute the service pack.

The service pack is extracted into four subdirectories.
<ul>
<li>Service Pack 4 for NT (i386)
<li>Data Access Components (mdac)
<li>Internet Explorer 4.01 (msie401) - we already have this installed from the option pack
<li>The ssx materials
</ul>
The Y2K setup will use the <b>i386</b> and <b>mdac</b> materials.

If you re-execute the <b> y2ksetup</b> program, it automatically detects that the proper patches have been installed.
<p>
Note that it says, "No <i> known </i> Year 2000 issues ...".  Make sure to recheck the Microsoft web site for any new service packs.
