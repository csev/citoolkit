<h2>Installing and Managing Windows NT</h2>

<p>This section is designed to introduce you to Windows NT and the necessary tools you
will need to operate Windows NT. This assumes that you have some experience with
Windows-95 or Windows-98 including installation and configuration.</p>

<p>This is designed as a self-paced tutorial with a series of exercises. The exercises are
intended to be performed in order from start to finish. Later exercises depend on the
successful completion of the earlier exercises. Once all of the exercises have been
performed, you will have a working system with the following software installed and
configured:

<ul>
  <li>Windows NT 4.0 (path level 4.0 with Y2K fixes)</li>
  <li>Internet Information Server 4.0 (FTP and web service)</li>
  <li>Microsoft Visual InterDev 6.0 and FrontPage98</li>
</ul>

<p>After completing the exercises, you should actually reinstall the system using the
settings that you determine to be the best for you r particiular situation. The tutorial
materials can be used as a reference as you install your system.</p>

<h2>References</h2>

<p>One of the reasons that many sites choose to run Windows-NT is the large amount of
supporting books and training materials available.&nbsp; In general you can go to your
local bookstore and browse until you find something that solves your problem.&nbsp; The
following books were used as references while working on this material:

<ul>
  <li>Need Microsoft Inside NT</li>
  <li>Need Microsoft Inside FP</li>
  <li>MCSE: NT Server 4 Study Guide, Matthew Strebe, Charles Perkins, James Chellis, Sybex,
    Inc, ISBN 0-7821-1972-7</li>
  <li>Inside Microsoft Visual Interdev, Ken Miller [et al], Microsoft Press, ISBN
    1-57231-583-0</li>
  <li>Build Your Own Visual Interdev Web Applications, Dan Wesley, Coriolis Group Books, ISBN
    1-57610-139-8</li>
  <li>FrontPage for Windows, Phyllis Davis, Deborah Craig, Peachpit Press, ISBN 0-201-69694-0</li>
</ul>

<p>You should purchase serveral books to use as reference while you are doing the
exercises.&nbsp; You should follow along in your books as you go through each phase of the
tutorial so you become familiar with the material in your books.</p>

<p>Another area which you should consider is the pursuit of Microsoft certification and a
Mcirosoft Certified Professional or Microsoft Certified Software Engineer.&nbsp; You can
find information regarding Microsoft certification at <a
href="http://www.microsoft.com/certification/">http://www.microsoft.com/certification/</a>.
&nbsp; While getting this certification is a good way to increase your value to your
organization, it is also a good way to motivate yourself to study how Windows NT operates.
&nbsp; If you are going to be a professional system adminstrator, it is a good idea to
begin to learn the tools of the trade.</p>

<h3>A Word of Caution</h3>

<p>Operating a production is a significant responsibility.&nbsp; Your users will expect
that the server is always up.&nbsp; If groups are placing their content on your server,
then they would normally expect the system to be up all of the time.&nbsp; If your site
contains valuable information, it should be up so that your customers can access this
information.</p>

<p>This technical responsibility leads one to begin to behave as a &quot;system
administrator&quot;.&nbsp; You might end up carrying a beeper and you might come in late
at night or on a weekend to solve a technical problem.&nbsp; On the other hand because
these systems are generally quite reliable so outages do not happen all that often.
&nbsp; Being a system administrator can be a source of pride as your users access the
useful information in your system.</p>

<p>In addition to the technical responsibilities, you will also have some ethical
responsibilities.&nbsp; Users may have passwords or other personal information on the
server.&nbsp; A system administrator must have very strong ethics.&nbsp; One should never
use their &quot;power&quot; as administrator in an unethical manner.&nbsp; You also have a
responsibility in the areas of mainting the integrity, security and privacy of your system
and the data in the system.</p>

<p>This tutorial is designed to teach you just enough to make you dangerous.&nbsp; You
will be able to install and configure a server and get it into production.
&nbsp; Unfortuantely, when the first crisis happens you&nbsp; may not be ready to handle
it.&nbsp; So, even after the system is up and running smoothly, you need to improve your
skills.</p>

<h3>On to the Tutorial</h3>

<p>This tutorial is designed to accomplish several tasks

<ul>
  <li>Install and configure Windows-NT</li>
  <li>Install and configure Server Software</li>
  <li>Install and configure Client Software</li>
  <li>Backup the system, simulate a complete disk loss and reload the system</li>
</ul>

<p>The tutorial is not even close to being the definititive documentation on any of these
topics.&nbsp; For example, many books have been written on how to use FrontPage to edit
web pages but there is exactly one paragraph on editing web pages in the entire tutorial.
&nbsp; You can think of the tutorial as a quick overview or table of contents to these
software components.&nbsp; It is the &quot;Cliff Notes&quot; of NT documentation.</p>
